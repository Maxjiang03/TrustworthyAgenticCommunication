"""Gate G-10 spike — the end-to-end pilot, and the LAST gate.

Part G's row, verbatim:

> **End-to-end pilot:** the benign running example through `B0` and `B3`,
> producing `ObservedRequest`, `MediationEvent`, `ToolIngressEvent`,
> `EffectEvent`, and independent `reference_allow` / `observed_forwarded` /
> `admission_breach` / `realized_harm` / `false_block`. **Green; oracle uses
> only raw evidence + sealed `IntendedInvocation` + trusted mediation/ledger;
> every prior DAG gate passed.** — *readiness to author the confirmatory corpus*

**The scope is narrower than the machinery available, deliberately.** This is a
**readiness** gate: can the apparatus produce the five record types and the five
independent quantities end to end, on the **benign** example, through **two**
arms. It is not the confirmatory campaign, not a nine-arm matrix, not a
statistical protocol. All three exist and pass elsewhere; running them here
would not strengthen the adjudication and would blur what is certified.

    L1  all four record types, both arms, LEDGER-BACKED
    L2  the five quantities, produced SEPARATELY, per arm
    L3  the source restriction, verified BEHAVIOURALLY on this run
    L4  every prior DAG gate passed -- a conjunct of this criterion
    L5  the failing worlds: a missing record type, and a forbidden source

**Platform.** `EffectEvent` needs the real ledger, whose enforcement is Win32
share-mode locking (ADR 0014 — it does **not** degrade). Off-platform the
ledger-dependent limbs report **NOT ADJUDICATED**, never a green tick: a
readiness gate that certified readiness on a platform where the ledger cannot
run would certify nothing. The same rule G-12 applies to its ledger limbs.

Nothing here is timed. G-3 owns cost and its figures live in `smoke/g3/` only.
