"""The measured segment's code extent, pinned structurally (ADR 0026, STEP 4).

Every test has a positive arm and a negative arm so no assertion can pass
vacuously. `frozen_parameters` row 1 settles the "lightweight" claim over
`presentation + boundary_verification`, so **what those two spans bracket is
part of the frozen decision** and cannot be left resting on a comment. A span
whose boundaries are documented but not asserted drifts.

Four things are asserted, exactly as STEP 4 lists them:

1. `presentation` brackets `arm.present(...)` **alone**;
2. `boundary_verification` brackets `arm.decide(...)` **alone**;
3. **no effect-ledger write occurs inside either** -- the ledger is an
   experimental instrument with no deployment counterpart, so charging it to
   any arm would measure the apparatus;
4. neither span includes `provision` or `delegate`.

Plus the audit-sink bound: `B3` carries `audit = 1` and `_audit` runs inside
`decide`, so a sink performing disk or network I/O there would charge `B3` for
the apparatus. The decision path refuses one.

**No number is emitted anywhere in this file.** Span *boundaries* are compared
for containment and ordering; no duration is computed, reported or compared
against a threshold. `IA-3` stays `[UNVERIFIED-IA]` for G-3.
