"""Regression suite for the golden-thread pilot corpus (ADR 0007, EXP1 STEP 4).

Every test has a positive arm and a negative arm so no assertion can pass
vacuously. Under test: the committed documents match a deterministic
regeneration; the authority sets in the sealed truth are what the frozen
authorizer computes (never hand-written); the SUT-visible/sealed separation
holds; and `fixtures/confirmatory/` stays empty (PROJECT_RULES.md red line 1).
