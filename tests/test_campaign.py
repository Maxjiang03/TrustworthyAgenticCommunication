"""The campaign entry point, and the pilot matrix **from oracle verdicts** (STEP 6–8).

The first time this study scores itself. Every cell below is produced by
`src/harness/oracle/`, which imports no SUT module and names no verdict field
(gate G-12's L2) — so `A`/`B` here comes from the trusted `MediationEvent` the
harness emitted, never from the arm's `(admitted, reason_code)` pair.

**Three comparisons, and STEP 8 is explicit that they are not the same thing:**

1. against **§E.4**, cell by cell;
2. against the **reason-code matrix** the existing suites report;
3. and the cells the oracle **cannot** score, named with the reason rather than
   filled in from a reason code.

Agreement with **§E.4** is the result: an independent recomputation from sealed
truth reproduces what the specification predicted. A disagreement would be a
finding, and neither the predicate nor the cell would be adjusted toward the
other.

Agreement with the **reason-code matrix** is weaker than it looks, and this
suite says so rather than banking it: the `A`/`B` column and the reason code
both trace to the same trusted `MediationEvent`, so their agreement is
**structural** — the record being internally consistent — not two independent
measurements coinciding. What the oracle genuinely adds is `reference_allow`
and `admission_breach`, which no reason code could produce, because
correctness is a relation between the decision and sealed truth and no reason
code has access to sealed truth.

Platform-independent: `ledger_backed=False`, so no Win32 handle is involved.
That has a consequence this file states rather than hides — **`realized_harm`
is not scored on these runs**, because with no ledger the absence of effect
records is indistinguishable from the absence of effects, and `False` would
read as *no harm*. `realized_harm` is exercised on constructed ledgers in
`tests/test_oracle_predicates.py`, where the evidence exists.

Nothing here is timed (EXP6 forbidden action 1) and no gate is run.
