"""`B3+` and the bounded `jti` replay cache (EXP3 STEP 11).

Every test has a positive arm and a negative arm so no assertion can pass
vacuously. Under test: ADR 0027's frozen parameters **and no others**, SS F.5's
consumption semantics, and the one cell `B3+` exists for -- `B3` admits a
bit-identical replay and `B3+` blocks it.

**No test here sleeps.** ADR 0027 makes every consumer of `Delta` take `now`
as an injected parameter precisely so an over-window fixture can advance a
logical instant; sixty seconds of real waiting per repetition, at >= 200
repetitions per configuration, would cost hours and would make the suite's
runtime a function of `Delta`. A test below asserts that no replay path
sleeps.

**This is NOT gate G-9** and nothing here claims it. G-9 adjudicates atomic
**multi-process** check-and-insert under concurrency and induced backend
error; this cache is atomic within one process and has no backend. `IA-9`
stays `[UNVERIFIED-IA]`.

Platform-independent.
