# Experiment Architecture — Final Consolidated (Implementation Candidate for Smoke Tests)

**Project:** Trustworthy Agentic Communication — measuring authorization-scope propagation and its cost at the A2A→MCP boundary
**Author:** Yixian Jiang (3154807J), MSc Cybersecurity, University of Glasgow
**Supervisor:** Professor Shahid Raza
**Consolidates:** `DESIGN_REVISION_v0.4.1.md` + all corrections in `DESIGN_REVISION_v0.4.1a_ERRATA.md`, folded into one authoritative document.
**Status:** **Implementation candidate — NOT sealable.** This is the specification the implementation follows to run the feasibility smoke tests in Part G. **No confirmatory experiment, no sealing, and no v0.5** until every in-scope Part G gate passes. No statement here may be described as "proven by specification"; every implementation assumption is enumerated in §F.4 with the gate that must confirm it.
**Evidence grades used throughout:** **[VERIFIED]** = checked against a primary source (RFC / protocol spec / Biscuit spec or FAQ) this session; **[DESIGN]** = a project decision, internally consistent but not externally mandated; **[UNVERIFIED-IA]** = a property a library or environment must have, not yet confirmed in code (see §F.4).

---

## Part 0 — How to read this document (for the implementer)

1. **Do not implement past a failing gate.** Part G defines a dependency DAG. If a gate fails, stop on that branch and apply the fallback in the gate-outcome policy; record it as an ADR entry.
2. **The pilot corpus is the only corpus you may run.** The confirmatory corpus does not exist yet and must not be authored or executed during smoke tests (§A.8, Part H).
3. **Two checks are blocking before any capability coding:** the Biscuit monotonicity semantics (§F.3 / G-2) and complete mediation + effect-ledger interposition (G-6 / G-7). Two more are blocking before any comparative claim: matched per-hop authority with independent `Allowed(AT_i)=C_i` verification (G-13) and the identity-plane split with the four-way DPoP taxonomy (§D / G-14).
4. **Symbols are frozen in §A.0.1.** Every formula uses `P_i` (immutable signed-block prefix) and `C_i = Allowed(P_i; Γ, κ, Ω)` (authority set). Hashes cover `P_i`, never the mutable proof tail.
5. **Nothing is a result yet.** Every expected-outcome cell in Parts D/E is a *prediction to be tested on the sealed corpus later*, not an observed finding.

# Part A — Scientific frame

## A.0 Status of claims

Three grades, kept distinct: **[VERIFIED]**, **[DESIGN]**, **[UNVERIFIED-IA]** (defined in the header). The single most important consequence: the confused-deputy amplification prevention is a **[DESIGN]** decision resting on **[UNVERIFIED-IA]** assumptions about the chosen capability library, **not** a proven property, until the §G gates pass.

### A.0.1 Canonical type definitions (used by every formula below)

These separate the immutable signed structure from the mutable proof tail and from the authority set, so no formula conflates them.

- **`SignedBlock_i`** — the `i`-th Biscuit block in canonical serialization (authority block for `i = 0`, attenuation block for `i ≥ 1`), including its block signature and the carried next-public-key, **excluding** the token's mutable proof tail (the trailing single-use secret or final seal signature).
- **`P_i`** — the **canonical signed-block prefix** `⟨SignedBlock_0, …, SignedBlock_i⟩`, the append-only list of signed blocks up to hop `i`, serialized canonically. Immutable once created; **does not** include the mutable proof tail.
- **`Γ`** — the frozen project **authorizer configuration** (its checks, allow/deny policies, and its fixed trusted-key set; §A.6.1).
- **`κ`** — the **Authorization Server root public key**.
- **`Ω`** — the frozen, finite **action/resource ontology**; authority is always a subset of `Ω`.
- **`C_i = Allowed(P_i; Γ, κ, Ω) = { x ∈ Ω | authorizer(P_i, x; Γ) = permit ∧ crypto_chain_ok(P_i; κ) }`** — the **effective authority set** admitted by prefix `P_i` under authorizer `Γ`, verified against `κ`, restricted to `Ω`. `C_0 = U_task`.

**Commitment rule [DESIGN, ADR 0003 — replaces the raw-byte hashing rule].** Every capability-state commitment commits to the **ordered signed-block prefix `P_i`**, never to the full token with its mutable proof tail — and never to raw container bytes: **protobuf is not a canonical encoding**, so a semantically equivalent re-encoding (field reordering, non-minimal varints) changes raw bytes, and a raw-byte hash would bind an encoding rather than the block sequence and falsely reject legitimate requests. Commitments are therefore taken over **signature-derived block identifiers**: `BlockID_i` is block `i`'s signature — the Biscuit revocation identifier **[VERIFIED: SPECIFICATIONS.md "Revocation identifiers": the revocation identifier for a block is its signature]** — extracted only from a token whose chain verified against `κ`. The symbol `H(P_i)` **denotes** `commit_prefix(BlockID_0..BlockID_i)`: SHA-256 over the domain-separated, versioned, length-delimited sequence (`"AASC-CAP-COMMIT"` ‖ version `0x01` ‖ alg `0x01` (Ed25519-only) ‖ `u32be(count)` ‖ each `u32be(len) ‖ BlockID`); unsupported version/algorithm values fail closed. Concretely: HTC `parent_prefix_hash := commit_prefix(BlockID_0..BlockID_{i−1})`, HTC `child_block_hash := BlockID_i`, INV `capability_hash := capability_commitment(P_n) = commit_prefix(BlockID_0..BlockID_n)`. The proof tail carries no block identifier and a re-encoding changes no signature, so HTC/INV bindings are stable across a legitimate append **and** across semantically equivalent re-encodings.

## A.1 Central thesis (frozen-benchmark wording; no frequency or adoption claim)

> MCP defines an **optional** HTTP authorization profile: when authorization is used, an MCP server acts as an OAuth 2.1 resource server and verifies that a presented token was issued for it. A2A v1.0 defines authentication and leaves authorization to the implementation, and it specifies an **in-task authorization workflow** in which an agent needing additional credentials transitions the task to `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` and the client supplies secondary credentials obtained out of band; A2A defines **no** standardized task grant and **no** normative per-hop monotone transformation that preserves an upstream task grant as a bound on downstream MCP tool effects. OAuth 2.1 is an **authorization framework**; **TLS** provides transport security. Whether the user's task grant is preserved across the A2A-to-MCP boundary is therefore not guaranteed by the protocols but determined by deployment choices. This dissertation constructs a **frozen benchmark** of delegation scenarios and measures, on that benchmark, how a ladder of deployment mechanisms behaves when authority crosses the boundary: whether the authority exercised at an MCP tool call remains within the user's task grant, and what security and runtime cost each mechanism incurs. The comparison holds task-authorization semantics, action and resource ontology, and execution substrate identical across mechanisms, so the only variables are how authorization is issued, propagated, attenuated, and bound to the individual invocation, and what online dependencies and overhead each mechanism incurs. All quantitative results are properties of this frozen benchmark; the study makes **no** claim about the frequency of such failures in deployed systems, nor about how widely any mechanism is adopted. **[VERIFIED: MCP authorization profile is optional and OAuth-2.1-based; A2A v1.0 `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` in-task auth with out-of-band credential acquisition; neither defines a normative task-grant transform.]**

**Framing note (prevents overreach).**

> This study does not claim a capability token is the only mechanism capable of expressing tool-level least privilege, and makes no claim about real-world prevalence. A token-exchange deployment configured with fine-grained authorization details can express comparable authority. A Datalog policy inside a capability, an OAuth scope, and a rich authorization request all depend on a shared, out-of-band vocabulary of actions and resources; none derives task requirements autonomously. What the benchmark isolates is which security properties follow from a mechanism's configuration and which require an explicit cross-hop authorization-preservation and invocation-binding mechanism, and at what cost.

## A.2 Research questions

- **RQ1.** Which authorization properties do the MCP and A2A specifications guarantee at the A2A-to-MCP boundary, and which do they defer to the implementer?
- **RQ2.** On the frozen benchmark, how often does the authority actually exercised at the boundary exceed the user's task grant, and under which configurations does the excess survive? Decomposed into the authority admitted at the boundary, the authority the request required, and the authority actually exercised (from an independent effect ledger).
- **RQ3.** For each baseline and each matched leave-one-out variant, what is the per-family attack outcome under each family's own success predicate, and the false-blocking outcome on a benign workload with near-miss cases, **on the constructed instance set**? *Update, 2026-08-02 — amended by **ADR 0037**. This question ended “on **seen and sealed held-out instances**” until this date; the previous wording is retained here so the record shows the sequence rather than only the destination.* The held-out third is **cut**, so RQ3's answer is qualified **wherever it appears**: this study reports attack and false-blocking outcomes on the **constructed** instance set only and makes **no claim** about generalization to instances outside it. The word *generalizes* and its variants must not appear in any RQ3 claim.
- **RQ4.** What is the absolute added latency of each mechanism, separated into setup, delegation, boundary-verification, and end-to-end components, under cold and warm conditions, and how does the security-versus-overhead trade-off compare?

## A.3 The three scopes (strict separation)

- **`U_max`** — long-lived maximum authority the user permits the Supervisor to hold; bounds what the Authorization Server may issue.
- **`U_task`** — authority the trusted Authorization Server mints at task start for this task; the **only** authorization input any runtime principal sees; carried authentically in the signed capability. This is `C_0`, the root of the attenuation chain.
- **`τ_gt`** — harness-only ground-truth task-required scope; visible to the **offline oracle only**; **no system-under-test principal may read it** (enforced in code; Part H freeze checklist). Used solely to score how tightly a mechanism tracked least privilege.

`U_task` is minted by the AS at task start, **not** derived by the Supervisor. The Supervisor and every downstream hop may only **narrow** it. The claim is therefore **"B3 preserves an authenticated upstream task grant with per-hop monotone narrowing,"** not "B3 autonomously derives task least privilege."

## A.4 B3 is an additional layer on OAuth, not a replacement [DESIGN, D28]

In the B3 arm the caller is still authenticated to the MCP boundary using OAuth 2.1 and TLS exactly as in the B2 arms; the OAuth access token still establishes MCP resource authorization and the acting identity. What B3 adds, and the OAuth token does not carry, is the root-signed monotonically-attenuating **capability** (`C_0..C_n` and labels), the **holder-transition-certificate (HTC) chain** (binding each hop to the next holder's identity key), and the **per-invocation binding assertion (INV)** (binding authority to the concrete tool call). The capability governs *what authority may be exercised*; the OAuth layer governs *authentication and MCP resource authorization*; **TLS** governs transport. B3 does not remove or bypass the OAuth resource-server check; it layers authorization-preservation and invocation-binding above it. Effective authority is the **intersection** of OAuth resource authorization and capability authority.

## A.5 Enforcement algorithm (pre-execution rule over `R`; `A` measured after execution)

`A` (exercised authority) is a post-execution observable and **cannot** be checked before allowing; the pre-execution rule is over `R` (required authority).

```
C_n = authority( verify_capability_chain(capability, κ) )     # = Allowed(P_n; Γ, κ, Ω), §A.0.1
R   = required_authority( concrete_request, server_policy )   # server computes from tool/resource/args;
                                                              # NEVER an agent-reported field

allow  ⟺  crypto_chain_ok(P_n; κ)          # signed-block chain verifies to root key
        ∧ authorizer_policy_ok(P_n; Γ)     # frozen authorizer Γ permits (block scoping, §A.6.1)
        ∧ htc_chain_ok                     # HTC chain valid to κ (§F.2)
        ∧ holder_proof_ok                  # INV signed by terminal HTC holder identity key
        ∧ invocation_binding_ok            # INV binds capability_hash/task/invocation/aud/method/tool/digest, in-window (§F.2)
        ∧ R ⊆ C_n                          # containment
        ∧ context_policy_ok                # capability label POLICY vs independently verified payload LabelAssertions (§A.6)
        ∧ approval_artifact_ok             # for high-risk actions (§F.2)
        ∧ oauth_resource_authorization_ok  # MCP resource server accepts AT@aud for this server
        ∧ identity_plane_consistency_ok    # oauth_actor(AT) maps to terminal htc_holder key (§A.5.1)

# After execution the oracle checks A ⊆ R, A ⊆ C_n, A ⊆ U_task from the effect ledger.
# Any allow with A ⊄ C_n is an enforcement/execution defect (mediation or tool-trust violated).
```

Under complete mediation, a trusted tool performing only the requested action, and no hidden side effects, `allow` with `R ⊆ C_n ⊆ … ⊆ C_0 = U_task` yields an expected `A ⊆ U_task`. This is **verified post-hoc** (§F.3 INV-5/6), not assumed.

### A.5.1 Three identity notions (MUST NOT conflate) [DESIGN, from E3/E5]

- `resource_owner = (iss, sub)` — the end user on whose behalf authority was granted; the OAuth subject.
- `oauth_actor = (iss, act) or (iss, client_id)` — the acting agent presenting the token (RFC 8693 `act`/`client_id`).
- `htc_holder` — the terminal holder identity key named by the HTC chain, required to sign INV.

The identity-plane check maps **only `oauth_actor → htc_holder`**. It **MUST NOT** require `resource_owner = holder` — delegation means the actor differs from the resource owner. INV additionally carries `access_token_hash = H(AT@aud)` so a capability + holder proof cannot be combined with a *different* access token than the one whose resource authorization was checked.

## A.6 Context labels — ingestion-vs-issuance resolution [DESIGN, D29 + E8]

Labels are asserted at ingestion by a trusted source (they exist before task-time capability issuance), so a single capability signature cannot cover both. `context_policy_ok` therefore evaluates the capability's label **policy** (Datalog over label facts) against **independently verified payload `LabelAssertion`s**, resolved **by payload digest** — not labels read from `C_n`, and not a caller-asserted label. For each value a tool touches, the boundary looks up the `LabelAssertion` whose `payload_digest` matches, verifies its signature under the trusted label issuer, and uses that verified label. Egress to a recipient is permitted only if `(verified label, sink)` is in the frozen allowed-sink policy, or a valid `DeclassificationArtifact` covers it. Derived values take the least-upper-bound (join) of input labels.

- **MSc model (what §E scores).** Trusted **pre-labelled payloads**: each fixture data item carries a label fixed at authoring time, signed by a fixture label issuer. The MSc F4 claim is explicitly **"propagation and egress-policy enforcement over trusted pre-labelled payloads,"** not runtime label origination.
- **Conference model.** Full ingestion-time signed labels with independent verification; the interface above already supports it, so no later interface change is needed.

### A.6.1 Biscuit monotonicity: three distinct checks [VERIFIED]

**Do not conflate** `crypto_chain_ok`, `authorizer_policy_ok`, and effective authorization.

- `crypto_chain_ok(P_i; κ)` — the signed-block chain verifies against `κ`. A cryptographically valid appended attenuation block satisfies this **even if it contains a widening fact**; appending is an untrusted-holder operation and is *expected* to verify.
- `authorizer_policy_ok(P_i; Γ)` — the project authorizer `Γ` permits the concrete request.
- `C_i = Allowed(P_i; Γ, κ, Ω)` under **default block scoping**: a check/policy trusts facts from the authority block, the authorizer, and its own block only.

**MSc profile restriction (MUST).** In the MSc profile, `Γ` **MUST NOT** enable any `trusting {public_key}` annotation and the token **MUST NOT** contain third-party blocks. The only trusted origins are the authority block and the authorizer. Any capability with a third-party block, or any authorizer importing external-key facts, is **out of profile** and **MUST** be rejected before evaluation.

**Monotonicity invariant, over authority sets:**
```
INV-2 (effective monotone):  ∀ i ∈ [1,n]:  C_i ⊆ C_{i−1}   where C_i = Allowed(P_i; Γ, κ, Ω)
```
This holds **by Biscuit's block-scoping semantics under the MSc profile**: later-block facts are not trusted by the authority block or the authorizer, third-party trust is disabled, so adding `SignedBlock_i` can only add checks and therefore only remove elements from the authority set. Monotonicity is **not** enforced by rejecting widening blocks at signature verification; a widening fact simply has no effect because nothing trusts it. **[VERIFIED: Biscuit Datalog reference — "adding a block can only restrict what a token can do, and never extend it"; default trust is authority block + authorizer + same block only; third-party facts require `trusting {key}`.]**

# Part B — Decision log (ADR)

## B.1 Repealed / superseded

| Decision | Action | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **D3 (v0.2): "B3 = B2 + six modules, strict superset / replacement"** | **REPEALED**, replaced by **D28** (B3 is an additional layer on the OAuth substrate; the cumulative intuition survives only as the §C credential-flow composition). | Superset framing wrongly conflated "adds authority-governance" with "replaces the OAuth check." |
| **D23 (v0.4): "holder binding via RFC 7800 `cnf`," as if capability-native** | **SUPERSEDED by D31**: RFC 7800 `cnf` is an OAuth/JWT construct, **not native to Biscuit**; Biscuit block signatures use single-use keypairs proving chain linkage, not delegate identity **[VERIFIED, FAQ]**. Holder binding is the project-defined **HTC** (§F.2), signed by each hop's identity key. `cnf` is used **only** in the DPoP arm (D34). | Prevents mis-describing a bolted-on mechanism as capability-native. |
| **D11/D12: "B3 derives task least privilege"** | Superseded by **D18**: "preserves an authenticated upstream task grant with per-hop monotone narrowing." | The system cannot authentically derive task-required scope at runtime. |
| **Any "not uniformly adopted" / frequency phrasing** | **REMOVED** (D40). | Benchmark cannot support a prevalence claim. |
| **"ready to seal" status** | **REVOKED.** Implementation candidate; sealing gated on Part G. | v0.5 only after smoke tests pass. |
| **Flat single `B2-task` arm** | **SUPERSEDED by D19** (three arms, §C). | A mixed arm made H-F1 unfalsifiable. |
| **"RFC 8693 inherently down-scopes"** | **REMOVED**; replaced by the pinned experiment AS profile (D27 + E2). | RFC 8693 leaves per-hop exchange and narrowing to deployment policy **[VERIFIED]**. |

## B.2 Decisions in force (consolidated)

D1, D2 (real OAuth 2.1 baseline), D4–D10, D13/D21 (independent oracle: three sources, per-family predicates, log-integrity failure), D17 (three scopes), D18 (grant-preservation claim), D19 (three OAuth arms), D20 (`R ⊆ C` pre-execution rule), D22 (Biscuit appends per hop **[VERIFIED]**; the format defines sealing as a terminal operation, but the chosen binding does not expose it and this design never seals — see the D22 note below and ADR 0002), D24 (label provenance, MSc-narrowed), D25 (approval as verifiable artifact), D26 (security = exact counts, no CI; latency = the only CIs), D27 (per-hop online exchange is a deployment property, not an RFC necessity **[VERIFIED]**), D28–D40 (§B.1 and the new-decisions set: DPoP arm D34, rewritten H4 D35, matched ablations D36, B3⁺ jti semantics D37, pilot/confirmatory separation D38, unverified-assumption enumeration D39, frozen-benchmark scoping D40). Additional consolidated decisions from the errata: three-scope separation, identity-plane split (A.5.1), HTC full spec (§F.2), composite oracle (§F.1/Part I), F1 split and matched per-hop authority (§E), four-way DPoP taxonomy (§D), two-phase OAuth cost (§E), gate DAG and seal loop (Part G/H). Plus the build-vs-reuse rule (ADR 0004; note below); the corpus-seal rule — the sealed confirmatory corpus stores scenario specifications, deterministic key seeds, and the generator, never pre-minted token bytes (ADR 0007; Part H note); the G-4 split — the AS construction spike may start ahead of G-6/G-7, while G-4 adjudication stays where the DAG puts it with unchanged criteria (ADR 0008); the frozen `H_JCS` construction with its digest-field classification (ADR 0009; §F.2); the §K LLM-demonstration scope — retained, qualitative only, outside Parts A–J and outside the seal (ADR 0010; §J.7); the commitment-family string rendering — lowercase hex, matching `H_JCS`, with `P_hashes` classified as the ADR 0003 prefix commitment (ADR 0011); and the `ingress_request_digest` settlement — `H_JCS`, recorder-side at the tool, closing the ADR 0009 G-7 deferral (ADR 0012); and the sealed measurement platform — the confirmatory campaign runs on Windows, the sealed environment includes the OS, the POSIX ledger variant is deferred post-submission, and no cross-platform claim is made until it passes the five G-7 checks (ADR 0014); and the AS placement — the pinned experiment AS is `src/sut/oauth_as/`, out-of-process with its signing key never in an agent process, importable by no other `src/sut/` module and by **no** `src/harness/` module, so the instrument never issues the credentials it adjudicates (ADR 0015; G-4 Phase 1 design `smoke/g4/DESIGN.md`); and the `Ω`/`Γ` freeze — the seven-element action/resource ontology and the MSc-profile authorizer, shipped with its **matched `−attenuation` ablation** as a delta that cannot differ in more than the one named respect, frozen as one loadable document (`src/harness/authorizer/omega_gamma_v1.json`, evaluated independently on each side rather than imported across the SUT/harness boundary) and hashed as `H(Γ)` under a third domain tag `AASC-GAMMA-DIGEST` that covers `Ω` as well as `Γ`, because `C_i ⊆ Ω` makes an ontology edit an authority-widening edit; `docs/frozen_parameters.md` row 8 is set, `Ω`/`Γ` stay amendable until Part H step 3, and any amendment re-triggers G-2 and the G-4 effective-authority limb (ADR 0016); and the **experiment AS profile as built** — the project RAR type URI `https://aasc.gla.ac.uk/rar/tool-authority` (AS configuration hashed by the Part H seal, **not** a new `frozen_parameters` row), the `requested_expires_in` extension parameter with an **explicit** over-long request refused as widening while an **unrequested** default is capped at `exp_{i−1}` (without which hop 2 is impossible), `identifier` constrained to one of its object's own `datatypes` so it can never widen, `Ω` membership checked on the expanded `(action, resource)` **pair** rather than value by value because `C_i ⊆ Ω`, and `may_act` populated from a spike-local delegation policy pending `frozen_parameters` row 5 (ADR 0017; gate record `smoke/g4/REPORT.md`). And the **holder-binding constructions and the frozen identity-plane registry** — `INV.access_token_hash` fixed as `lowercase_hex(SHA-256(b"AASC-AT-DIGEST" ‖ 0x01 ‖ u32be(len(t)) ‖ t))` over the presented token's ASCII bytes, distinct by tag and encoding from both `ath` and `H_JCS` (which consumes the same bytes), closing ADR 0009's category (c) for that field and `smoke/g4/DESIGN.md` §9 C2; the HTC/INV signing input fixed as `TAG ‖ VERSION ‖ u32be(len(C)) ‖ C` over RFC 8785 canonical payload bytes, which is what makes §F.2's domain tags load-bearing in both directions (ADR 0018); and the §F.2.1 registry frozen as `src/harness/verifier/identity_registry_v1.json` and hashed as `H(R)` under the tag `AASC-REGISTRY-DIGEST`, fixing **structure and derivation labels rather than key bytes** — the line ADR 0016 drew for `Γ`/`κ` — with a stated necessity per entry that the loader enforces, `docs/frozen_parameters.md` **row 11** set, and any amendment re-triggering G-11 and G-4's `actor→holder` limb; it is the actor→holder mapping **only** and not the `task_authorization_policy`, which stays UNSET (ADR 0019; gate record `smoke/g11/REPORT.md`). And the **A2A delegation port** — the Supervisor→Specialist hop is built behind a one-operation transport port with an in-process adapter injected at the composition root, `a2a-python` stays unpinned because its gate has not run and Part G defines none (an enumeration gap left to the author), and the adapter's divergences from A2A v1.0 (no wire, no task lifecycle, no `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED`, in-envelope credentials, in-process errors) are disclosed as §J.5 item 20 rather than absorbed (ADR 0020). And the **label/sink/classification freeze** — `frozen_parameters` rows **4, 6 and 10** fixed as one loadable document (`src/harness/policy/label_approval_v1.json`) hashed as `H(Λ)` under the tag `AASC-POLICY-DIGEST`, following the ADR 0016/0019 pattern with a stated necessity per entry that the loader enforces: the vocabulary `public ⊏ internal ⊏ sensitive` with join, egress **derived** from `Ω` as "the effect carries a recipient" rather than enumerated, egress outcomes permit/escalate/block by label with an **unlabelled egress failing closed**, two sink classes with three allowed pairs, and `high_risk_actions = {mail.send, notes.delete}` / `sensitive_labels = {sensitive}`. §A.6 leaves open how rows 4 and 6 combine — it states the sink rule as a *necessary condition* while row 4 states an *outcome per label* — and **ADR 0023 settles it**: they do **not** compose. Row 6 is the **permit whitelist**, row 4 supplies the **severity** of a pair that is not whitelisted, and exactly one verdict is produced per cell (`(public, *)` and `(internal, internal-sink)` permit; `(internal, external-sink)` escalates; `(sensitive, *)` and unlabelled block). ADR 0022's first reading composed them and took the more restrictive, which falsified two of the frozen artifact's own necessity statements — the two rows answer different questions (*whether* versus *how severe*), so reconciling them was a category error. The freeze enables the **refusal** half of `context_policy_ok` and `approval_artifact_ok` only; the acceptance half needs `authz_context_hash`, still ADR 0009 category (c) owned by G-15, and scoring F4/F5 additionally needs labelled fixtures. Row 5 stays UNSET (ADR 0022). And **Phase-1 provisioning inside the AS process** — `python -m src.sut.oauth_as` mints one §E.2 Phase-1 base `AT@aud` per registered client at start-up via `issue_initial` (the pre-issued path, deliberately unreachable from the token endpoint and importable by no non-AS module) and emits them on the existing start-up JSON line to the runner-held pipe only; tokens are runtime-only (never disk, never the repo, never `results/`), coverage of the registered client set is exact and fail-closed, Phase 1 stays identical across arms and outside the delegation estimand, and the alternative of a new HTTP provisioning endpoint was rejected because it would grow the G-4-adjudicated surface and turn the pre-issued path into wire-reachable online issuance (ADR 0021). And the **Phase-1 grant of the delegating client** — its base `AT@aud` is provisioned with authority exactly `C_0 = U_task`, while every other client (including the specialist, whose token `B3` and `B-cap` present) keeps the coarse `Ω` grant. §E.2's "no delegation authority is expressed in the base token" holds for arms whose authority plane is elsewhere; in `B2-exchange-task` the token **is** the authority plane and the AS enforces `C_i ⊆ C_{i−1}` against the subject token's own grant, so a coarse base token would have made the AS **issue** an `F1-chain-tamper` widening to `(mail.send, mail/outbox)` — an element inside `Ω` — and would have broken G-13's cross-arm identity, since `B3`'s `C_0` is `U_task` and not `Ω`. This is the OAuth analogue of §A.3's "the AS mints `U_task` as `P_0`; the Supervisor only narrows": both are task-start issuance, outside the Phase-2 estimand. Path, call, shape and exclusion from the estimand stay identical across arms; only the granted set differs, because the two mechanisms put the narrowing in different places. Obtaining `AT_0` by a self-narrowing exchange was rejected as impossible under the pinned profile (`may_act` names the specialist, not the supervisor) and choosing an out-of-`Ω` tamper target was rejected as testing a malformed-request refusal rather than a widening refusal (ADR 0024).

**D22 note — this design never seals.** Further delegation is governed by the HTC chain (a new hop requires an `HTC_i` signed by the current holder's identity key, §F.2); further attenuation by any party is harmless because attenuation is monotone (§A.6.1); and a block appended after the terminal hop is rejected because it changes `H(P_n)` and therefore fails the `INV.capability_hash` binding (§F.2). Sealing is consequently **not required** by this design, and the absence of a seal API in the chosen Python binding does not affect it. `[Gate G-1; ADR 0002]`

External functionality enters only as **pinned dependencies**, each pinned exactly and only after its gate passes: `biscuit-python==0.4.0` (G-1, ADR 0002/0003); a JCS library (G-8); a DPoP/JOSE library (G-5); an OAuth stack for the AS if viable (G-4); `a2a-python` and the official MCP Python SDK after their gates (G-6/G-7 exercise the MCP mediation surface). Built from scratch: the HTC/INV constructs, the nine-arm orchestration, the independent effect ledger + oracle, the attack-family fixtures, and — most likely, since per the concluded external investigation no off-the-shelf Python AS supports both RFC 8693 down-scoped exchange and RFC 9396 RAR — a behaviourally faithful OAuth 2.1 AS. **AIP is not forked**: reusing its code would violate oracle independence (the oracle must share no implementation with anything it judges, D13/D21); AIP anchors the "measurement, not novel mechanism" citation and serves as comparator (feature-matched table or P3 comparator arm; its own paper names a controlled OAuth 2.1 comparison as future work). This decision does not change the DAG order. `[ADR 0004]`

# Part C — Credential-flow table (per baseline)

Notation: **AT** = OAuth access token; **AT@aud** = audience-restricted AT (RFC 8707); **XCHG** = RFC 8693 token exchange under the **pinned experiment AS profile**; **CAP** = root-signed attenuating capability (`P_0..P_n`, authority `C_0..C_n`); **HTC** = holder-transition-certificate chain; **INV** = per-invocation binding assertion; **DPoP** = RFC 9449 proof (method+URI only); **cnf** = RFC 7800 confirmation claim (OAuth/DPoP arm only). **All agents obtain the same pre-provisioned resource-specific base `AT@aud` in Phase 1 (§E two-phase).**

| Baseline | Phase-2 Supervisor→Specialist (A2A) | Specialist→MCP boundary | Binds authority to the invocation | Prevents stolen-credential reuse by another holder |
|----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **B0** | none | plain call | nothing | nothing |
| **B1** | static API key forwarded | API key in header | nothing | nothing (bearer) |
| **B2-broad-noexchange** | AT (broad) forwarded | AT@aud (broad), bearer | audience only | nothing (bearer, in-window) |
| **B2-exchange-broad** | XCHG → AT′ (broad, scope unchanged) | AT′@aud, bearer | audience only | nothing (bearer) |
| **B2-exchange-task** | XCHG → AT′ narrowed to `C_i` (+RAR) | AT′@aud (task scope), bearer | audience + scope | nothing (bearer, in-window) |
| **B2-exchange-task-DPoP** [D34] | XCHG → AT′ narrowed to `C_i`, **DPoP-bound (cnf=holder jkt)** | AT′@aud + **DPoP proof** over method+URI | audience + scope + **holder key** | **DPoP holder binding** — stolen token unusable without holder key; **DPoP covers method+URI only, not tool/body** [VERIFIED] |
| **B-cap** | append block → `P_i` (offline, no XCHG) | CAP `C_n`, **no HTC, no INV** (bearer capability); OAuth authn on (§E.1) | scope via `C_n` only | nothing (bearer capability) |
| **B3** [D28] | append block → `P_i` **+ HTC hop** (offline) | AT@aud (auth) **+ CAP `C_n` + HTC chain + INV** | audience + scope + **holder identity** + **method+tool+canonical body/args digest + access_token_hash** | **HTC chain + terminal holder proof** — stolen capability unusable without the holder identity key, **and** INV binds the exact call |
| **B3⁺** | as B3 | as B3 **+ jti consumed in bounded cache** | as B3 + duplicate detection | as B3, plus bit-identical replay blocked |

**Three holder-binding regimes made distinct:**
1. **Bearer holder theft** (B2-broad, B2-exchange-*, B-cap): bearer token/capability; anyone capturing it in-window can present it.
2. **DPoP holder binding** (B2-DPoP): AT bound to a holder key via `cnf`/`jkt`; the caller proves possession. Defeats bearer theft. **But** the DPoP proof covers method+URI only **[VERIFIED, RFC 9449]**; since MCP tool calls are JSON-RPC to one endpoint, it does **not** bind the specific tool or body/args — it stops *who* replays, not *what* is substituted at the same endpoint.
3. **B3 body/args binding** (B3): the INV assertion binds `capability_hash, access_token_hash, task_id, audience, method, tool, canonical_request_digest, iat, exp`, signed by the terminal holder identity key named in the HTC chain. Defeats bearer theft (holder proof) **and** same-endpoint tool/argument substitution (canonical body/args digest), which DPoP does not cover. Body/args binding is credited to **INV**, not the capability.

# Part D — Attacker × key-possession × tampering-point matrix; rewritten H4; DPoP taxonomy

## D.1 Rewritten H4 [D35] — two falsifiable hypotheses

> **H4a (post-signature, non-holder tampering).** An adversary who captured a valid credential but does **not** possess the terminal holder identity key attempts to (i) reuse it as a different caller, or (ii) substitute tool/arguments after signing. Prediction: `B2-exchange-task` (bearer) admits both; `B2-exchange-task-DPoP` admits (ii) at the same endpoint but blocks (i); **B3 blocks both** (HTC terminal-holder proof blocks (i); canonical body/args digest in INV blocks (ii)). Falsified if B3 admits either, or if DPoP blocks same-endpoint tool/argument substitution.
>
> **H4b (compromised-holder misuse).** An adversary who **does** possess the terminal holder identity key (compromised Specialist) attempts to exceed the grant. Prediction: **no** mechanism blocks a compromised holder acting *within* `C_n` (legitimate authority); **all** `C_n`-enforcing mechanisms block it from exceeding `C_n`, because scope containment is independent of holder identity. Falsified if B3 blocks in-scope compromised-holder actions (would be over-blocking) or any `C_n`-enforcing mechanism admits out-of-`C_n` actions.

**B3 does not claim to stop a compromised holder from misusing authority it legitimately holds.** It claims to stop scope escalation (chain) and credential misuse by non-holders (HTC + INV). The compromised-holder-within-scope residual is out of scope of every mechanism and stated as such.

## D.2 DPoP attacker taxonomy [VERIFIED basis; replaces the earlier informal model]

Four distinct adversaries, each with stated held artifacts and position:

- **`dpop-stolen-AT-key-substitution`** — has `AT@aud` but not the DPoP holder key; presents the token with its own key. **Blocked** by DPoP (proof fails against the token `cnf`/`jkt`).
- **`dpop-captured-proof-replay`** — has a complete valid method+URI DPoP proof and the token; resubmits bit-identically. **Not** blocked by DPoP alone (same method+URI); blocked only by an authenticated-request-ID replay cache keyed on the DPoP `jti`.
- **`dpop-first-use-body-mutation`** — a malicious component **between the holder's proof signing and the TLS client** alters the body/tool on the **first** use, reusing the holder's genuine, not-yet-seen proof. **Not** blocked by DPoP (body/tool outside the proof); blocked by an INV body/args binding.
- **`dpop-compromised-holder`** — **possesses** the DPoP holder key; can sign fresh valid proofs. No holder-proof mechanism blocks a compromised holder within scope; scope containment still bounds it.

The earlier "pre-emptive submission that does not reuse the victim's proof" phrasing is **removed**: an attacker without the holder key cannot produce any valid DPoP proof, so there is no valid-DPoP request without either the captured proof or the holder key.

## D.3 The matrix

Tampering points: **T-reuse** (captured credential as a different caller); **T-tool** (substitute tool, same endpoint); **T-args** (substitute arguments, same tool); **T-scope** (request authority outside `C_n`); **T-replay** (bit-identical in-window resubmission). Key possession: **K-none** (only a captured credential); **K-holder** (possesses terminal holder identity key). ✅ = blocked, ❌ = admitted, — = legitimate/NA.

| Attacker key | Tampering point | B2-exchange-task (bearer) | B2-exchange-task-DPoP | B3 | B3 conjunct that blocks |
|--------------|-----------------|:-------------------------:|:---------------------:|:--:|-------------------------|
| K-none | T-reuse | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | `holder_proof_ok` + `htc_chain_ok` |
| K-none | T-tool (same endpoint) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | `invocation_binding_ok` (tool) |
| K-none | T-args (same tool) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | `invocation_binding_ok` (canonical_request_digest) |
| K-none | T-scope (outside `C_n`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `R ⊆ C_n` (containment) |
| K-none | T-replay (bit-identical) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ (B3⁺ ✅) | none in B3; B3⁺ jti cache |
| K-holder | T-scope (outside `C_n`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `R ⊆ C_n` (independent of holder) |
| K-holder | in-scope action | — | — | — | legitimate; no mechanism blocks (H4b) |

DPoP closes T-reuse but not T-tool/T-args at a shared endpoint — exactly the gap B3's canonical body/args binding fills. A measured, falsifiable distinction, not an assertion of superiority; the residual difference is credited to **INV**, not the capability.

# Part E — Baseline ladder, two-phase OAuth, F1 split, expected matrix, bitmasks

## E.1 The ladder [DESIGN, D19] — every strong baseline receives identical `C_0..C_n`

| Baseline | Mechanism | Receives per-hop `C_i`? | Prevents F1-terminal? | Binds invocation? | Holder-bound? | Online per-hop? | Isolates |
|----------|-----------|:-----------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|----------|
| **B0** | no delegation protection | n/a | no | no | no | no | the vulnerability exists |
| **B1** (appendix) | static API key | n/a | no | no | no | no | a static secret adds nothing |
| **B2-broad-noexchange** | OAuth 2.1, broad, bearer, RFC 8707 | broad only | no | no | no | no | audience binding alone does not attenuate |
| **B2-exchange-broad** | + XCHG, scope unchanged | broad | no | no | no | **yes** | isolates the exchange round-trip cost from narrowing |
| **B2-exchange-task** | + XCHG narrowed to `C_i` (+RAR) | **yes** | **yes** | no | no | **yes** | the fair strong OAuth arm |
| **B2-exchange-task-DPoP** [D34] | + DPoP (cnf=holder jkt) | **yes** | **yes** | method+URI only | **yes** (key) | **yes** | DPoP holder binding vs B3 body/args binding |
| **B-cap** | attenuating capability, no HTC, no INV; OAuth authn **on** | **yes** | **yes** | no | no | no (offline) | offline attenuation, separated from binding |
| **B3** | full control layer | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | no (offline) | binding + holder + labels + offline stateless verification |
| **B3⁺** | B3 + bounded jti cache | **yes** | **yes** | yes + dup detection | **yes** | no | price of closing duplicate replay |

**B-cap fixed [E6]:** primary B-cap fixes `oauth_authn = 1` on the same OAuth substrate as B3, and **MUST** verify audience and expiry. A standalone-capability (`oauth_authn = 0`) configuration may exist **only** as a separate exploratory arm, never in the formal matrix. No undecided cell appears in the formal matrix.

**Honest headline (paste-ready):**

> On the frozen benchmark, a well-configured token-exchange deployment (`B2-exchange-task`) and the capability baselines all prevent scope amplification, because all enforce the same narrowed `C_n`. They differ in three measured respects: the token-exchange arms bind authority to an audience and a scope but not to the individual invocation, whereas B3 binds each invocation and each holder; the token-exchange arms narrow by contacting the authorization server on each delegation hop under the tested configuration, whereas the capability arms attenuate offline; and the bearer token, once issued, is replayable by any holder in its window, whereas B3's holder binding prevents reuse by a different party. The benchmark measures the security consequences on the invocation-integrity and replay families and the overhead consequences on the decomposed latency axis.

## E.2 Two-phase OAuth [DESIGN, E2] — setup cost vs delegation cost

- **Phase 1 — setup (identical across all agents; measured separately as `setup_cost`, excluded from the delegation estimand).** Every agent obtains a resource-specific base `AT@aud` through the **same** pre-provisioned path (auth-code + PKCE against the pinned AS, or a pre-issued fixture token), identical for B2 and B3. No delegation authority is expressed in the base token; it establishes only MCP resource authorization and the OAuth actor identity.
- **Phase 2 — delegation (the measured `delegation_cost`, per hop; the quantity compared).** B2 arms perform, at each hop, an online XCHG under the pinned AS profile to obtain `AT_i` with authority `C_i`; B3/B-cap perform an **offline** attenuation `P_{i−1} → P_i` (authority `C_i`) with no AS round-trip. The online-vs-offline difference is the intended measurement.

**Pinned experiment AS profile [DESIGN, replaces "RFC 8693 inherently down-scopes"].** RFC 8693 does **not** by itself guarantee a narrower exchanged token; scope/audience/`authorization_details` are AS-policy-determined **[VERIFIED]**. This experiment pins an AS exchange profile that, at hop `i`, issues `AT_i` with exactly authority `C_i` and **enforces** `C_i ⊆ C_{i−1}` by construction (rejecting any exchange that would widen beyond `C_{i−1}`). An **independent harness verifier** recomputes `Allowed(AT_i)` over `Ω` and asserts `Allowed(AT_i) = C_i` for every hop and every strong baseline (gate G-13). If the AS/library cannot realize the profile, it is disclosed and the affected baseline is marked, never silently mis-provisioned.

## E.3 F1 split [DESIGN, E2]

- **`F1-root`** — the request requires `R ⊄ U_task` (outside the root grant `C_0`). Expected **block** on every strong baseline (all enforce `C_n ⊆ C_0`).
- **`F1-terminal`** — `R ⊆ U_task ∧ R ⊄ C_n` (inside the root grant but outside the narrowed terminal authority). Expected **block** on every strong baseline **iff** it realized the full `C_0→…→C_n` narrowing; a baseline enforcing only `C_0` would admit it — hence matched provisioning and the `Allowed(AT_i)=C_i` check are mandatory.
- **`F1-chain-tamper`** — the attacker manipulates a hop to make `C_i ⊄ C_{i−1}`. Expected **block** on B-cap/B3 by Biscuit block scoping under the MSc profile (§A.6.1) and on exchange arms by the pinned AS profile refusing a widened `AT_i`. **NA** for B0, B1, `B2-broad-noexchange`, `B2-exchange-broad` (no per-hop authority chain to tamper with).

## E.4 Scenario families and the expected matrix

Families: **F1** amplification (root / terminal / chain-tamper); **F2** identity; **F3** invocation integrity {`dpop-stolen-AT-key-substitution` (=T-reuse), `dpop-first-use-body-mutation` (=T-tool/T-args), audience-mismatch (OAuth negative control), expired-token (OAuth negative control), `dpop-captured-proof-replay` (=bit-identical)}; **F4** information-flow/egress; **F5** human approval. Held-out instances sealed from F1, F3, F4.

**Expected allow/block/NA matrix** (frozen benchmark; **predictions**, exact counts to be measured on the sealed corpus, not asserted). **B** = expected block, **A** = expected allow (attack succeeds / benign proceeds), **NA** = not applicable.

*Update, 2026-08-02 — corrected by ADR 0035, recorded rather than silently rewritten.* The **`F2 invalid_credential`** row above read **`NA`** for `B0` until this date; it now reads **A**. Hand `B0` a credential that does not verify and it **admits**, because it runs no boundary check of any kind — a **measurable vulnerability**, and the null arm's vulnerability is the baseline every other cell is read against. Recording it as `NA` filed a hole under *not applicable*, which is the same harm ADR 0031 corrected one row down. The governing rule, now stated so it is reusable: **give the arm the case and observe — if it admits, that is `A`; `NA` is reserved for an arm that cannot express the case at all** (ADR 0028's meaning). This repository had already settled the identical question for the `F3 expired token` row, in `tests/test_f3_matrix.py`: *"they read no token, so 'expired' is not a condition they can perceive. That is the vulnerability §E.4 predicts as A, not an inability to express the case (which would be NA)."* **A second finding travels with it and is a limit on the derivation rule itself:** this row's `NA` set **cannot be derived from the §E.5 bitmask at all**. `oauth_authn = 0` holds for `B0` **and `B1`**, yet `B1` is **B** — it verifies a **static API key**, demonstrated in `tests/test_b1.py`, and §E.5's ten columns carry **no bit for a shared secret** (`B1`'s row is `0…0 1`, only `audit`). So `NA` for any credential-verification row must come from §E.1's arm definitions and be confirmed against behaviour; deriving it from `oauth_authn` alone gets `B1` wrong. ADR 0035 audits the remaining `NA` cells: the four `F1-chain-tamper` ones **survive** — an arm with no per-hop chain has nothing to append a widening block to, so its instance would be byte-identical to `gt-f1-root` and scoring it would double-count one instance rather than measure a second — while the six on `F2 wrong_holder_proof` are **reported for adjudication, not corrected**, because they rest on the reasoning this correction overrules and §D.2's own matrix scores the corresponding `K-none | T-reuse` cell for `B2-exchange-task` as ❌ *admitted*.

*Update, 2026-08-02 — the `NA` test, adjudicated (ADR 0035, dated addition). **The six `F2 wrong_holder_proof` cells STAND; their stated reason does not.*** The standard for every `NA` in this table is now: **if the instance built for an arm would be byte-identical to an instance already scored on another row, scoring it double-counts one instance rather than measuring a second.** It replaces artifact-absence — *"the arm holds no such object"* — which ADR 0035 overruled for `B0`, and it is stronger because `NA` is a statement about the **corpus** (there is no second instance here to score) rather than about the mechanism. The two rows that looked inconsistent are not: `F3 dpop-stolen-AT-key-substitution` has the attacker take **the token**, which every token-carrying arm can express and `B2-exchange-task` **admits** — a bearer token is not bound to a holder, so **A**; `F2 wrong_holder_proof` has the attacker present **a holder proof signed by the wrong holder**, and `B2-exchange-task`'s presentation contains no such object, so the only instance constructible for it *is* the T-reuse instance, byte for byte. Scoring both would record one instance twice. Under this test §E.4 carries `NA` in exactly **two rows, ten cells**, and **each names the row its instance would duplicate**: `F1-chain-tamper`'s four duplicate **`gt-f1-root`** (no per-hop chain to append a widening block to), and `F2 wrong_holder_proof`'s six duplicate **`F3 dpop-stolen-AT-key-substitution`** (no holder proof to be wrongly signed) — and all ten arms are already scored `A` on the row they would duplicate. For `B-cap` the equivalence is measured rather than argued, by `tests/test_b_cap.py::TestCapturedCapabilityContrast`. **No `NA` cell in this table now rests on artifact-absence**, and `F2 wrong_principal` remains *deferred — unscored*, emphatically **not** `NA` (ADR 0028).

*Update, 2026-08-01 — corrected by ADR 0031, recorded rather than silently rewritten.* The two **OAuth neg. control** rows above read **`NA`** for `B-cap` until this date; they now read **B**. `NA` asserts that an arm **cannot express** the case (the meaning ADR 0028 pinned when it insisted the deferred `F2 wrong_principal` row is *emphatically not* `NA`), and `B-cap` can express both, does, and blocks — measured, with negative arms, in `tests/test_b_cap.py::TestOAuthAuthnIsOnAndVerifies`. §E.1's `B-cap fixed [E6]` paragraph **mandates** exactly that: `oauth_authn = 1` on the same OAuth substrate as `B3`, and it **MUST** verify audience and expiry. The table also contradicted **itself** — `B-cap` is **B** on `F2 invalid_credential` and on `F2 unauthenticated_caller`, both reached through the same OAuth verification path, while its `NA` on `F2 wrong_holder_proof / wrong_dpop_key` is **correct** and **stays**, because it genuinely carries no holder binding. The error was a *capability arm → NA* pattern applied to two rows labelled *OAuth neg. control*. **This corrects a PREDICTION, not code**: `B-cap`'s behaviour is required by §E.1/E6, so changing the arm to match the old cells would have violated the specification governing it. ADR 0031 also audits every other `NA` in this table against the §E.5 bit that governs its row and finds **no other cell with the same pattern**; `B3` and `B3⁺` carry no `NA` anywhere.

*Update, 2026-08-01 — corrected by ADR 0032, recorded rather than silently rewritten.* The two rows above read **`A†`** for `B-cap` until this date; they now read a plain **A**. The dagger means *this cell flips when the shared monitor is attached*, and `B-cap`'s does not: its §E.5 bitmask sets `context = 0` and `approval = 0` — a bearer capability with **no policy plane** — so it never runs the two §A.5 conjuncts a monitor answers for, and its cell is **A under both configurations**, measured in `tests/test_f45_matrix.py`. The footnote below is not violated as WORDED (it says *the OAuth arms* also block, and `B-cap` is not an OAuth arm), but a symbol meaning *flips with configuration* on a cell that cannot flip misleads in exactly the way G-15 exists to prevent — a reader would take `B3` **B** versus `B-cap` `A†` for a configuration artifact a shared monitor would erase, when it is a genuine mechanism difference. **Same drafting cause as ADR 0031's `NA → B` correction:** §E.4 filled `B-cap` in as *a capability arm* rather than from its own §E.5 bits, so it inherited `B3`'s policy-plane annotation here and a *capability-arm → NA* pattern there. ADR 0032 audits every other `A†` and finds **none with the same pattern**; it also records that the `context`/`approval` bits alone do **not** settle it — all five daggered arms carry `0/0`, and the four OAuth arms' daggers are correct because a monitor reaches their decision through a layer orthogonal to the bitmask, whereas `B-cap`'s would have to arrive through the very conjuncts its bitmask gates off. For `B-cap`, attaching the monitor is not a configuration change but a change of arm: `context = 1, approval = 1` **is** `B3`.

*Update, 2026-08-01 — gate **G-15 PASSES** (`smoke/g15/REPORT.md`).* The footnote below is now **adjudicated rather than asserted**: the same `ContextApprovalMonitor` class object, over one frozen `H(Λ)`, is attached to the OAuth arms and to `B3` alike, and all 72 F4/F5 cells were measured under **both** `monitor_attached` configurations. The `A†` prediction is reproduced — the four OAuth arms admit absent the monitor and block with it. **The residual is the finding and belongs in the results chapter in these words: with the shared monitor, F4/F5 measure the MONITOR rather than the MECHANISM, so no capability-versus-OAuth advantage may be claimed from these two families in either direction.** Beside it, a second result rather than a defect: **without** a monitor configured, `B3` and `B3⁺` refuse the **benign controls** too, because both policy conjuncts fail closed — so the capability policy plane is useful **only when a monitor is configured**, and without one `B3` is not safer on these families, it admits nothing. That is a **false-blocking** result and belongs in the results chapter and the false-blocking analysis, not in limitations.

† F4/F5 comparisons are valid **only** among B3 and its matched ablations, **unless** the OAuth arms are given the **same** boundary-owned context/approval reference monitor (using the mechanism-neutral `authz_context_hash`, §F.2). A difference existing only because B3 has a monitor and the OAuth arm does not **MUST NOT** be reported as a capability-vs-OAuth advantage; it is a reference-monitor-configuration difference and is labelled as such (gate G-15). The A† cells therefore denote "admitted **absent** the shared monitor"; with the shared monitor the OAuth arms also block, and F4/F5 then measure the monitor, not the mechanism.

*deferred — unscored (ADR 0028).* The `F2 wrong_principal` subfamily is **deferred and not scored**; `frozen_parameters` row 5 (`task_authorization_policy`) is **deliberately not frozen**. It is emphatically **not** `NA`: `NA` asserts that an arm *cannot express the case*, which is false here — every arm could, and **the study declines to score it**. The distinction is the whole point of the annotation, and the previous `NA | NA | B | …` row said something untrue about `B0` and `B1`. Row 5 has no anchor outside the author's judgement — no standard, RFC or reference deployment fixes which principal may carry which task — so any value would make this row measure conformance to an invented artifact, indistinguishable in the results tables from the rows anchored to `Ω`/`Γ`, the registry and the RFCs. The other three `F2` subfamilies (`invalid_credential`, `wrong_holder_proof`/`wrong_dpop_key`, `unauthenticated_caller`) are **retained and scored in full**; `F2` as a family is not dropped. See §J.5 item 21 for the validity statement this obliges.

**Replay/holder detail** (four-way taxonomy, with the orthogonal control arms):

| Subcase | B2-exch-task (bearer) | B2-DPoP | B2-DPoP + replay cache | B2-DPoP + INV-only | B3 | B3⁺ |
|---------|:---------------------:|:-------:|:----------------------:|:------------------:|:--:|:---:|

| dpop-captured-proof-replay (bit-identical) | A‡ | A | **B** | A | A | **B** |

‡ bare bearer has no authenticated per-request ID, so the replay cache **cannot** attach to `B2-exch-task`; its replay exposure is inherent to the bearer choice, not closed by the orthogonal layer.

**Fixture constraint for `F3 dpop-captured-proof-replay`, fixed in advance [DESIGN, ADR 0027].** The bit-identical replay **MUST be constructed WITHIN `Δ`** (`frozen_parameters` row 3, 60 s). That row predicts `B3` = **A** and `B3⁺` = **B**, and the single cell is `B3⁺`'s entire reason to exist. Since ADR 0027 `Δ` also governs **INV freshness at the boundary**, a replay constructed *outside* `Δ` would be blocked by `B3` too — for a reason unrelated to duplicate detection — and the distinction would **collapse**, making `B3` look stronger than predicted. That is the direction that flatters this work's own hypothesis, which is why the constraint is recorded **before** the fixture is built rather than discovered after the cell disagrees: an adjustment made then could not be told apart from adjusting the result. Every conjunct other than duplicate detection must still pass, so only the `jti` cache can catch it.

## E.5 Module bitmask per baseline (and matched ablations)

```
bits = [ oauth_authn | crypto_chain | authorizer | htc/holder | invoke | contain | context | approval | jti_cache | audit ]
```

| Baseline / variant | oauth | crypto_chain | authorizer | htc/holder | invoke | contain | context | approval | jti | audit |
|--------------------|:-----:|:------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|:---:|:-----:|
| B0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| B1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| B2-broad-noexchange | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| B2-exchange-broad | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| B2-exchange-task | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | (scope in token) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

| B-cap | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| **B3** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| **B3⁺** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| B3 −attenuation (unsafe control, §E.6) | 1 | 1 | *root-only* | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| B3 −holder | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| B3 −invoke | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| B3 −contain | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| B3 −context | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| B3 −approval | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

(For `B2-exchange-task`, containment is enforced by the AS-issued token scope, not a boundary module; the parenthetical marks that. `audit` never sits on the decision path — toggling it tests log completeness and latency, **not** prevention; the pre-registration does **not** predict that removing `audit` changes any prevention outcome.)

## E.6 Matched ablation closing semantics [DESIGN, D36 + E1] — orthogonal fixtures

Each ablation is `B3` with exactly one decision-path conjunct disabled and an **orthogonal fixture** blocked only by that conjunct.

| Variant | Conjunct disabled | Closing semantics (precise) | Orthogonal fixture |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| **−attenuation** (renamed from −chain; **non-Biscuit unsafe control**) | effective-authorization recomputation over the chain | Instead of `C_n = Allowed(P_n; Γ, κ, Ω)`, authorize against `Allowed(P_0; Γ, κ, Ω)` — **ignoring every attenuation block**. A well-formed Biscuit authorizer cannot be made to trust later-block widening without third-party keys (forbidden by the MSc profile), so this is implemented as an **unsafe reference monitor that bypasses Biscuit attenuation**, present only to show narrowing produces the F1-terminal block. | A capability where `C_n ⊊ C_0` and `R ∈ C_0 \ C_n`: full B3 (evaluates `C_n`) **blocks**; `−attenuation` (evaluates `C_0`) **admits**. |
| **−holder** | `holder_proof_ok` + `htc_chain_ok` | Skip HTC-chain and terminal-holder proof; accept as bearer capability | A capability captured from the legitimate holder, presented by a **different** key with a self-signed INV |
| **−invoke** | `invocation_binding_ok` | Skip binding of authority to method/tool/args/audience/window; accept any in-scope tool | A valid in-scope capability replayed against a **different tool or arguments**, same audience, in-window |
| **−contain** | `R ⊆ C_n` | Skip containment; allow if chain and bindings verify regardless of whether `R` exceeds `C_n` | A holder-bound, invocation-bound request requiring authority **outside** `C_n` |
| **−context** | `context_policy_ok` | Skip the label→action-type policy | An in-scope outward call carrying a **sensitive-labelled** payload with no declassification artifact |
| **−approval** | `approval_artifact_ok` | Skip approval-artifact verification | A high-risk in-scope action with **no** valid approval artifact |

Each orthogonal fixture is designed so **only** the named conjunct blocks it; every other conjunct passes. This is what makes each a matched leave-one-out rather than a component-only build.

# Part F — Implementation schemas and formal invariants

## F.1 EvidenceBundle, sealed intent, trusted mediation, effect ledger [DESIGN, D33 + E7]

The oracle **never** reads a SUT-computed auth verdict or a SUT-computed digest. It recomputes everything from raw evidence, sealed truth, and an immutable external ledger.

    principal: str; timestamp_ns: int
```

**Unforgeable correlation ID [DESIGN].** `correlation_id` is a harness-minted random 128-bit value bound into the sealed `IntendedInvocation`, the `MediationEvent`, the `ToolIngressEvent`, and (for authenticated mechanisms) the INV `jti`. The SUT cannot fabricate, swap, drop, or duplicate the linkage without detection; gate G-12 injects swap/drop/duplicate/concurrency faults and the oracle flags any mismatch.

## F.2 INV assertion, holder-transition certificate, approval artifact [DESIGN, D30/D31/D25 + E4/E8]

The three objects below are the `HolderTransitionCert` (HTC), the `InvocationAssertion` (INV), and the `ApprovalArtifact`, given here as signed-payload templates rather than plain pydantic classes because each is a **signed** object with a domain tag; the field lists are the authoritative schemas.

**Domain separation and versioning (MUST).** Every signature is over a byte string prefixed with a fixed domain tag and schema version, so an HTC can never be reinterpreted as an INV or across versions. Tags: `"AASC-HTC-v1"`, `"AASC-INV-v1"`. Each object carries `schema_version` and a `kid` selecting the signer key from the identity-plane registry.

**`H_JCS` construction (frozen) [DESIGN, ADR 0009].** `H_JCS(x) = lowercase_hex( SHA-256( b"AASC-JCS-DIGEST" ‖ 0x01 ‖ u32be(len(C)) ‖ C ) )`, where `C` is the RFC 8785 canonical UTF-8 bytes of `x` (`rfc8785==0.1.4`, ADR 0005). Same family as the §A.0.1 capability commitment — versioned, domain-separated, length-delimited, fail-closed on any unsupported version — with a distinct tag and no algorithm byte (the hash is fixed by the version), so the two constructions and a bare digest can never be confused. Output is 64 lowercase hex characters; this fixes the string encoding of every `H_JCS`-governed digest field (`intended_request_digest`, `effect_request_digest` — the full field classification is in ADR 0009). Oracle-side implementation: `src/harness/oracle/jcs_digest.py`; the SUT-side computation must be independent (D21), and the oracle never consumes a SUT-computed digest (§F.1).

```
# Hop 0 (issuance), signed by the AS root key κ:
HTC_0 = Sign_κ,"AASC-HTC-v1"(
    schema_version:1; kid:kid_AS

    signer_pubkey: κ_pub

    task_id; audience; iat; nbf; exp; depth:0 )

# Hop i ≥ 1, signed by the CURRENT holder identity key:
HTC_i = Sign_{holder_{i-1}},"AASC-HTC-v1"(

    iat; nbf; exp                       # exp ≤ HTC_{i-1}.exp (non-increasing)
    depth: HTC_{i-1}.depth + 1 )        # contiguous

# Per-invocation assertion, signed by the TERMINAL holder identity key:

    schema_version:1; kid:kid_{holder_n}
    capability_hash: capability_commitment(P_n)   # = commit_prefix(BlockID_0..BlockID_n), ADR 0003
    access_token_hash: H(AT@aud)        # binds the presented OAuth token (§A.5.1)
    task_id; audience; method; tool
    canonical_request_digest: H_JCS(raw_arguments)   # RFC 8785 JCS over arguments; frozen construction ADR 0009
    label_assertions_digest
    invocation_id (jti); iat; nbf; exp )

# Approval artifact — MECHANISM-NEUTRAL binding, so an OAuth arm with the same monitor can present it:
authz_context_hash = H( task_id, audience, tool, canonical_request_digest, resource_owner, oauth_actor )
ApprovalArtifact { authz_context_hash; approver_kid (trusted); iat; nbf; exp; jti; replay_rule; signature }
```

**Zero-hop rule (MUST).** With no delegation (`n = 0`), a valid chain is exactly `HTC_0` with `next_holder_pubkey = initial_holder_pubkey`; INV is signed by that key. No separate code path — `n = 0` is the general verification with a one-element chain.

**Verification (MUST all hold):** `HTC_0` verifies under κ with the HTC tag; for every `i ≥ 1`, `HTC_i.signer_pubkey == HTC_{i-1}.next_holder_pubkey` and `HTC_i` verifies under `signer_pubkey`; `task_id`/`audience` invariant; `depth` contiguous from 0; `exp` non-increasing, every `nbf ≤ now ≤ exp`; `prefix_hash`/`child_block_hash` match the presented `P_{i-1}`/`SignedBlock_i`; `terminal HTC.next_holder_pubkey == INV.kid` key; INV verifies under the terminal holder key with the INV tag; `INV.capability_hash == capability_commitment(presented token)` (recomputed from raw bytes, §A.0.1/ADR 0003); `INV.access_token_hash == H(presented AT@aud)`; `INV.canonical_request_digest == H_JCS(raw_arguments)`; the number of HTCs **equals** the number of presented signed blocks — every presented `SignedBlock_i` is covered by a corresponding `HTC_i`, and a block with no covering HTC is **rejected** (the `INV.capability_hash` check already detects such a block; this count check fails fast and yields an unambiguous reason code; implemented oracle-side as `check_htc_coverage`, ADR 0003) `[ADR 0002/0003]`. Verification requires only κ plus the in-chain holder keys resolved via the registry.

**Validity versus acceptance — two different questions, stated once [DESIGN, ADR 0027].** The MUST list above defines what makes a chain and an INV **valid**: it is a property of the artifacts, and `every nbf ≤ now ≤ exp` is the *issuer's* chosen validity window. It contains no `|now − iat| ≤ Δ` rule and never has. **Freshness is a boundary ACCEPTANCE POLICY** — how recently the assertion must have been made for *this* resource server to act on it — fixed by **ADR 0027** as `Δ` (`frozen_parameters` row 3) and applied by `invocation_binding_ok` at the SUT boundary. Citing §F.2 for it would be wrong, and the code does not. The consequence is a deliberate asymmetry, declared rather than left implicit: the **harness verifier** (`src/harness/verifier/holder_binding.py`) implements §F.2's MUST list, which gate G-11 adjudicated, and therefore carries **no** freshness check — acceptance policy is not its subject and adding it would change what G-11 verified. So the SUT boundary applies one condition the §F.2 verifier does not, and the D21 agreement between them covers a strictly smaller set of conditions than the SUT implements. Both facts are recorded where they bite: in the G-11 residuals below and in `tests/test_sut_signer_agreement.py`.

**Why HTC is separate from Biscuit [VERIFIED].** Biscuit's per-block signatures use single-use keypairs that prove blocks are correctly chained; only the authority block is signed by a well-known multi-use key. Those block keys do **not** authenticate *which principal* performed each attenuation. Holder binding needs delegate *identity*, so the HTC chain is signed by each hop's identity key and carries `next_holder_pubkey`; the terminal INV must be signed by the key the last HTC names, chaining back to issuance. This is a project construction layered on Biscuit, and is described as such.

### F.2.1 Identity-plane registry [DESIGN]

`actor_of(·)` maps an OAuth `act`/`client_id` claim to a single principal; the registry maps that principal to exactly one `htc_holder` public key. Every actor claim and holder key used in a scenario **MUST** resolve to exactly one principal; unmapped actors/keys are rejected. `resource_owner` subjects are recorded but are **not** part of the holder mapping. The registry, `Ω`, `Γ`, the frozen `task_authorization_policy` (task → authorized actor principals, for F2 `wrong_principal`), and the allowed-sink policy are all frozen and hashed before sealing.

## F.3 Capability-chain invariants [DESIGN, D32]

With `C_i = Allowed(P_i; Γ, κ, Ω)` (§A.0.1), `R` the required authority, `A` the exercised authority (from the ledger):

```
INV-1 (root):           C_0 ⊆ U_max
INV-2 (monotone):       ∀ i ∈ [1,n]:  C_i ⊆ C_{i-1}                # by block scoping, MSc profile (§A.6.1)
INV-3 (terminal):       C_n ⊆ C_0 = U_task                        # transitively
INV-4 (request):        allow ⟹ R ⊆ C_n                          # containment, pre-execution
INV-5 (effect≤request): A ⊆ R      # under complete mediation + trusted tool
INV-6 (effect≤grant):   A ⊆ C_n ⊆ U_task                          # composition; VERIFIED POST-HOC
```

INV-1..3 rest on Biscuit block scoping under the MSc profile; **the entire F1 result depends on the frozen `Γ` yielding `C_i ⊆ C_{i−1}` for every appended block — confirmed by gate G-2 for `biscuit-python==0.4.0` under the ADR 0016 freeze, with every `C_i` computed rather than asserted (`smoke/g2/REPORT.md`; IA-2, §F.4). The confirmation is scoped to those frozen bytes and that pin: any `Ω`/`Γ` amendment or library bump re-triggers G-2.** INV-4 is the containment conjunct. INV-5/6 are **checked by the oracle after execution** from the ledger; a violation indicates a mediation or tool-trust failure to report.

## F.4 Unverified implementation assumptions [D39] — nothing is "proven by spec"

| # | Assumption | Status | Gate |
|---|-----------|--------|------|
| IA-1 | The chosen Python Biscuit library exists, is maintainable, and exposes append-block attenuation + root-public-key verification with a stable API | **Verified by gate G-1** for `biscuit-python==0.4.0` (PyO3 over `biscuit-rust` 6.0.0; wheels for cp39–cp313; no Rust toolchain required): offline attenuation without the root secret, verification with the root public key alone, stable prefix commitments `H(P_i)` (the §A.0.1 **BlockID commitment**, ADR 0003 — encoding-independent, not a raw-container-byte hash), and append-detection all confirmed. **Residuals:** the binding is a 0.x API (a version bump re-triggers G-1); `BlockID_i` is the spec-defined revocation identifier (the block signature), so the commitment depends on the versioned **format specification**, not the 0.x Python API; the Biscuit format is **not formally audited**. | G-1 |
| IA-2 | Under the frozen `Γ`, `C_i ⊆ C_{i−1}` holds for every appended block, and third-party/`trusting` config is rejected as out of profile | **Verified by gate G-2** for `biscuit-python==0.4.0` under the `Ω`/`Γ` frozen by ADR 0016 (`H(Γ) = f63320c9da3731a6ea04dc51d9f6852f3a3e130182ce3a7fe251158751333deb`), with every `C_i` **computed** over `Ω` by the frozen `Γ` (one authorizer run per candidate per prefix), never asserted: a widening append verifies under `κ_pub` yet enlarges no authority set — shown for six broadening vectors including derivation rules, `expiry` extension and `token_audience` widening, the latter two probed under the condition they were meant to unlock — while legitimate narrowing yields `C_2 ⊊ C_1 ⊊ C_0 = U_task`; an attacker-signed third-party block (constructed in full) is rejected **structurally, pre-evaluation** and carries no authority even if evaluated; a `trusting {attacker_key}` authorizer is refused pre-evaluation, and is shown to admit the escalation if it is not. **Residuals:** exact 0.x pin (any bump re-triggers G-2, as it does G-1); the result is scoped to these frozen bytes and **any `Ω`/`Γ` amendment re-triggers this gate** (ADR 0016); the pinned library **verifies third-party tokens under `κ_pub` alone**, so out-of-profile rejection is load-bearing project code and the SUT-side independent implementation is still owed (D13/D21, verified at G-13) — *update, 2026-07-31: that residual is now **closed**. G-13 adjudicated D13/D21 on structure (`src/sut/capability/` imports nothing from `src/harness/`; the harness verifiers import nothing from `src/sut/`), on the instrument not reusing `src/sut/authz/boundary.py`, and on agreement — two independent implementations produced the same `C_i` on every hop of every cell. The rest of this residual stands*; the Biscuit format remains not formally audited (ADR 0002). | G-2 |
| IA-3 | Ed25519 signing/verifying of HTC+INV is deterministic and fast enough that boundary verification stays below the equivalence margin | **Verified by gate G-3** (2026-08-02) on the **row 9 sealed measurement platform**, which was locked in a separate commit *before* the measurement was taken. 1,000 HTC+INV pairs signed and verified per Part G's row; the **median `boundary_verification` cost is below the ADR 0025 threshold**, and the figures appear **only** in `smoke/g3/REPORT.md` — the repository-wide no-timing-number invariant became narrower on that date, not void. **Read the wording of this row carefully, because the gate is narrower than it:** G-3 measured `boundary_verification` **alone** against **row 2**'s 5 ms smoke threshold. It did **not** measure the **equivalence margin** this row's text names — that is **row 1**, whose estimand is `median(B3) − median(B0)` over `presentation + boundary_verification` with a 95% bootstrap CI upper bound below 20 ms, and which belongs to RQ4's campaign **after** the seal. ADR 0026 separated the two deliberately. So what is verified is *verification is fast on this platform*; whether the **added** cost sits under the margin is **not yet measured** and must not be inferred from this row. **One finding recorded rather than smoothed:** the measured headroom is **thinner than ADR 0025's prose expected** (it argued three- to tenfold). Neither the threshold nor the ADR was adjusted. **Hazards handled:** the P/E-core mask was **detected** via `GetSystemCpuSetInformation` and pinned fail-closed; AC power asserted; four batches run and **no thermal drift observed**. **A Linux CI run is regression protection only and is never adjudicative.** **Re-triggered by any change to row 9.** | G-3 |
| IA-4 | The OAuth stack (`authlib`) supports RFC 8693 exchange narrowing to `C_i` + RFC 9396 authorization_details, or a behaviourally faithful AS can be built | **Verified by gate G-4** — by the assumption's **second** limb. Its first limb is **refuted** for `authlib==1.7.2`: the Phase 1 probe found the `rfc8693` package to be a 162-byte docstring with zero symbols and `authorization_details` absent from the installed source, so `authlib` stays **unpinned**. A behaviourally faithful AS **was built** (`src/sut/oauth_as/`, ADR 0015/0017) on the stdlib plus `joserfc==1.7.4`, and G-4 Phase 2 adjudicated it (`smoke/g4/REPORT.md`): an RFC 8693 exchange issues a task-narrowed token carrying `C_i` as a single-type RFC 9396 RAR array and reporting the granted scope when it differs; **widening is refused as an error with no token issued** in all four planes (RAR expansion, audience, scope, expiry); the rejection catalogue answers with the exact codes and statuses; containment is byte-exact with no normalization (RFC 9396 §12) and confined to the **frozen** `Ω`; the boundary independently enforces the **intersection** of the capability and OAuth-resource planes; `sub` carries the resource owner with the actor in a nested `act` whose **outermost** element alone is consulted; the `actor→holder` mapping resolves and rejects unmapped actors; and `ath`, DPoP nonces and `htu` normalization behave per RFC 9449 — the first real exercise of the two G-5 hand-forwards. **Scope and residuals.** The adjudication first covered the criterion's **adjudicable limbs only**; the two residual limbs were **closed by gate G-11** on 2026-07-29, so the criterion is now fully adjudicated. `INV.access_token_hash` (L4) was scoped to a follow-on run after G-11 because no construction existed and INV did not exist — ADR 0018 fixed the construction and G-11 verified the binding through the real verifier, rejecting a swapped token; the `actor→holder` limb (L3) used the **spike-local C3 registry** (raw keys, not HTC terminal keys) and was re-run at G-11 against the registry frozen by ADR 0019, with the outcome unchanged (`smoke/g11/REPORT.md`); `may_act` came from a spike-local policy because `frozen_parameters` row 5 is UNSET, so the F2 `wrong_principal` family is not yet scored; the AT profile is RFC 9068-**shaped** and deliberately **not** RFC 9068-conformant (ADR 0006, design §8.3); an `Ω`/`Γ` amendment re-triggers the effective-authority limb (ADR 0016). | G-4 *Update, 2026-07-31 (addition, nothing above retracted): gate **G-13** confirms the built AS realizes the pinned profile **per hop end to end** — `Allowed(AT_i) = C_i` recomputed independently from the presented token over `Ω`, and a widening exchange refused with **no token issued** rather than clamped. The narrowing was verified at G-4 on the AS's own responses; G-13 verifies it on what an arm actually presents at the boundary.* |
| IA-5 | A DPoP-bound (cnf/jkt) access token can be issued/verified in the local AS | **Verified by gate G-5** for `joserfc==1.7.4` (JOSE surface only, ADR 0006), with issuance **simulated locally** (frame-local mint): `jkt` per RFC 7638/RFC 8037 (A.3 known answer reproduced by the library and an independent computation), `cnf.jkt`-bound token issue/verify (issuer key ≠ holder key), proof verification per RFC 9449 §4.3 items 3–9, 11 + the §6.1 binding, wrong-holder proof rejected **at the `cnf.jkt` ↔ proof-`jwk` thumbprint comparison**, independent `htm`/`htu` rejection, negative control green. **Residuals:** the **real AS is G-4** (token endpoint, RFC 8693/9396, `ath`, nonce — all still [UNVERIFIED-IA]); the four-way DPoP taxonomy is G-14; `htu` RFC 3986 normalization is a production-verifier concern (G-11/G-14); exact 1.x pin — any bump re-triggers G-5. | G-5 |
| IA-6 | The MCP Python SDK exposes tool-call handling where the boundary can mediate **every** call (complete mediation) and emit a `MediationEvent` | **Verified by gate G-6** for `mcp==1.28.1` (ADR 0013): every enumerated SDK dispatch path (documented protocol path, server-side convenience calls, internal dispatch, post-install registration, direct registry insertion, forged-request handler invocation) converges on the registered tool-function object, which the harness installer wraps (wrap-at-fn + wrap-on-insert registry); denial blocks execution (tool-side witness), a raising tool emits exactly one event, and with the interposition removed the same calls reach the tool with zero events (non-vacuity). **Residuals:** claim scoped to FastMCP servers built by the harness installer; in-process raw-reference/introspection paths excluded by SUT process separation (stressed at G-12) — *update, 2026-08-01: **process separation is now REAL and gate G-12 PASSES.** The SUT (both agents, the arm and the arm's decision) runs in a spawned child; `src/harness/sut_process.py` holds the pipe. The exclusion is no longer an assumption: a `gc.get_objects()` sweep run INSIDE the child finds **zero** `MediationBoundary`, `LedgerWriter`, `LedgerEffector`, `GoldenThreadRunner` and `IntendedInvocation` objects and **zero** loaded `src.harness` modules, with a negative arm confirming the sweep finds types the child really has. What this establishes: the raw-reference and introspection paths are excluded by ADDRESS SPACE. What it does NOT establish: complete mediation itself, which stays G-6's and is not reopened — G-12 relies on it rather than re-proving it, and reproduces the bypass world at the record level for that reason*; interposition targets private SDK internals — exact pin, any bump re-triggers G-6; boundary **policy** correctness is not claimed (G-2/G-11/G-13). | G-6 |
| IA-7 | An immutable external effect ledger + `ToolIngressEvent` recorder can be interposed at the tool, independent of agent self-report | **Verified by gate G-7** for `mcp==1.28.1` + the exclusive-share ledger process (`src/harness/effect_ledger.py`): ingress + effect events recorded with the harness-minted `correlation_id`; every SUT-side write/append/truncate/delete attempt fails at the OS level (Win32 `FILE_SHARE_READ`-only handle; attribute/`chmod`-proof); in-place modification rejected with bytes unchanged; the ledger survives a lying SUT self-report (the lie is detected from the ledger alone); an unreached tool produces zero entries. `ingress_request_digest` = `H_JCS` recorder-side (ADR 0012). **Residuals:** Windows-only enforcement — a recorded platform decision, not a footnote (**ADR 0014**: Windows is the sealed measurement platform; the POSIX variant is deferred post-submission and no cross-platform claim is made until it passes the five G-7 checks); in-process reachability inside the harness process excluded by SUT process separation and stressed at G-12 — *update, 2026-08-01: **stressed, and it holds.** G-7's five write paths (append, truncate, binary append, in-place modify, delete) were re-attempted from a GENUINELY separate process and all five were refused, while reading stayed allowed (`FILE_SHARE_READ`; the ledger is auditable, not secret). The child is handed the ledger path DELIBERATELY, because the protection is the parent's exclusive-share handle and not path secrecy — a test that withheld the path would prove the weaker thing — and a negative arm shows the same five attempts SUCCEED once the writer lets go. Gate **G-12 PASSES**; the Windows-only scope of the enforcement is unchanged (ADR 0014)*; record semantics are oracle territory (Part I). | G-7 |
| IA-8 | RFC 8785 JCS canonicalization agrees across signer and verifier | **Verified by gate G-8** for `rfc8785==0.1.4` (pure Python, Apache-2.0, typed): encoding-invariant canonicalisation (member order, insignificant whitespace, equivalent escapes), separate-process signer/verifier byte-identical agreement, RFC-vector conformance (§3.2.4 byte vector exact; §3.2.3 UTF-16 code-unit sort order; Appendix B numbers 24/24), fail-closed on out-of-model input (NaN/Infinity, lone surrogates, non-string keys, non-JSON types, ints at or beyond 2^53). **Residuals:** 0.x pin (any bump re-triggers G-8; the regression suite is the harness); the frozen `H_JCS` construction (hash function, domain tag, digest string encoding) is **underspecified here and deliberately not invented** — open decision, `smoke/g8/REPORT.md` §9; RFC 8785 is Informational, so conformance rests on the vector tests, not on a standards-track mandate. | G-8 |
| IA-9 | The jti cache (B3⁺) does atomic multi-process check-and-insert, fail-closed, under the harness concurrency | **Verified by gate G-9** (2026-08-01) for the single-writer arbiter of **ADR 0033**: the check-and-insert runs in a spawned process that serves one request at a time, so atomicity is a property of the SHAPE rather than of a lock that could be mis-scoped. **Exactly one** of N=8 concurrent bit-identical requests proceeds, asserted as a count and `{1}` across 20 trials; the **lock-removed world genuinely double-admits** (per-caller caches admit 8 of 8), so the result is a measurement rather than a race that happened not to occur; the **induced backend error denies in both shapes** (answered `error`, and killed mid-flight) against a healthy-arbiter positive control; and **overflow is REACHED** at the real frozen `2^16`, filled through the same `consume` path, with the next distinct id failing closed and an earlier entry surviving -- no unexpired entry is evicted to make room. The frozen budget is unmovable **by absence**: the arbiter accepts no capacity or TTL flag. Clock injected; nothing sleeps. **Residuals:** this establishes multi-process replay DETECTION, not cost (**IA-3** stays `[UNVERIFIED-IA]` for G-3) and not the DPoP taxonomy (G-14); `B3⁺`'s §E.5 bitmask is unchanged, since where the cache runs is not a ladder property; the arbiter is one process per campaign and its loopback channel carries an authenticated request IDENTIFIER, which grants no authority. | G-9 |

**HTC/INV correctness — the unnumbered assumption the G-11 row names, now verified.** The Part G G-11 row blocks *"IA (HTC correctness); H4a"*, but that assumption has **no numbered row in the table above** — an enumeration gap in D39's list, recorded here rather than closed by inventing an IA number (a renumbering is the author's call). Its status: **verified by gate G-11** for `src/harness/verifier/` (Ed25519 via `cryptography`, `rfc8785==0.1.4`, `biscuit-python==0.4.0`) over the registry frozen by ADR 0019 and the constructions fixed by ADR 0018. Every §F.2 MUST is a separately named check with its own reason code; all fourteen mutations the row names are rejected **for the condition each targets** — including domain-tag confusion in **both** directions, and a case added specifically because the identity-plane check was otherwise **masking** `htc_chain_linkage`; and the valid chain passes at `n = 2` **and** at the `n = 0` zero-hop case, with no branch keyed on the chain length. **Residuals:** `label_assertions_digest` and `authz_context_hash` remain ADR 0009 category (c), deferred to the F4 label decision (rows 4/6, UNSET) and **G-15**; the `ApprovalArtifact` is unbuilt — *update, 2026-08-01: **both closed**. **ADR 0030** fixes `payload_digest`, `authz_context_hash` and `label_assertions_digest` under three new domain tags, plus the three artifact signing domains, and builds the `ApprovalArtifact` together with the boundary-owned reference monitor that verifies it. ADR 0009 has **no category (c) field left**. Two things this does NOT change, stated because they are easy to conflate with it: this verifier still does not recompute `label_assertions_digest` (it implements §F.2's **validity** MUST list, and the label set is the monitor's question, in a different place); and G-15 is not thereby passed — ADR 0030 makes it **adjudicable**, because `A†` can now be tested by running an OAuth arm with and without the monitor rather than asserted*; the **SUT-side** INV signer is still owed (D21) and G-13 checks the two layers agree — *update, 2026-07-31: **closed**. The SUT-side signer exists, agreement is pinned by `tests/test_sut_signer_agreement.py`, and **G-13 adjudicated D21** rather than re-asserting it, on structure + non-reuse + agreement. Residual carried forward, and made precise on 2026-07-31 because the first wording was broader than the truth: agreement is evidence of independence only while the constructions differ, and the import scan **would** catch a refactor that made the verifier import `src/sut/authz/boundary.py` -- that is a cross-boundary import, and L4.W1 proved the scan non-vacuous by flagging one. What the scan **cannot** catch is **copy-paste convergence**: the token plane rewritten with the boundary's construction -- a capability-plane set built first, `scope` applied per request afterwards -- and no import at all. The two would then agree because they are the same algorithm, not because two constructions independently reached one answer, and every L1 equality would still pass. **The guard against that case is review of a change to the verifier, not a test** — the structural facts asserted in `smoke/g13/spike.py` and `tests/test_matched_authority.py` cover the import case and are not claimed to cover this one*; **the SUT boundary carries one ACCEPTANCE condition this verifier does not** — INV freshness `|now − iat| ≤ Δ` (ADR 0027, `frozen_parameters` row 3), added on 2026-07-31. That is deliberate and not a gap in G-11: this verifier implements §F.2's **validity** MUST list, which is what G-11 adjudicated, and boundary acceptance policy is a different question (see the validity-versus-acceptance note in §F.2). The consequence to keep in view is that the D21 agreement suite now covers a **strictly smaller** set of conditions than the SUT boundary implements, so agreement there is not evidence about the freshness check; `H(R)` deliberately does not cover key values (sealed at Part H step 3); the jti cache that makes single-use meaningful is **G-9**; row 5 stays UNSET so F2 `wrong_principal` stays unscored; and an amendment to the registry re-triggers G-11 and G-4's `actor→holder` limb. **IA-3 is untouched and stays [UNVERIFIED-IA] for G-3** — this gate establishes correctness, not that verification fits under the equivalence margin. `smoke/g11/REPORT.md`.

**[VERIFIED] facts (not assumptions):** Biscuit appends per hop; the format defines sealing as a terminal operation (not exposed by the chosen binding and not used by this design — D22 note, ADR 0002); Biscuit block keys are single-use and do not authenticate delegates; monotonicity is by Datalog block scoping, not signature rejection; DPoP proofs cover method+URI only; A2A leaves authorization to implementations and defines `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` in-task auth with out-of-band credential acquisition; MCP authorization is an optional OAuth-2.1 profile; RFC 8693 does not mandate per-hop exchange or down-scoping; RFC 7800 `cnf` is holder-of-key and should be paired with audience restriction.

## F.5 B3⁺ jti-cache semantics [DESIGN, D37]

```
Structure:    bounded map jti -> expiry_ns; max size; TTL eviction; key namespace = (mechanism_tag, jti).
Consumption:  at the boundary, AFTER all other conjuncts pass and BEFORE the tool executes,
              an ATOMIC check-and-insert:
                  if jti present and not expired -> REJECT as duplicate (no execution)
                  else insert(jti, now+Δ) and proceed
Atomicity:    single critical section; MULTI-PROCESS atomic (not just per-thread); no window in which
              two identical jti both pass (gate G-9).
Concurrency:  concurrent identical requests -> exactly one proceeds; the rest rejected.
Fail-closed:  on capacity or backend error, REJECT rather than admit on doubt.
Failure/retry:if the tool call fails AFTER jti consumption, the jti stays consumed for Δ; a legitimate
              retry within Δ is rejected as a duplicate. Deliberate, documented trade-off: B3⁺ trades
              retry-within-Δ for duplicate-replay prevention. Retries wait out Δ or carry a fresh jti.
Eviction:     entries older than Δ evicted lazily and/or by periodic sweep; never revives a valid jti.
Idempotency:  at-most-once ADMISSION per jti within Δ. Does NOT make the tool idempotent; prevents
              duplicate admission, not duplicate effects from a single admission.
```

The retry-vs-duplicate trade-off is why bit-identical replay is a *residual* in B3 and closed only in B3⁺ at a stated usability cost — and why the benign near-miss "legitimate retry within Δ" fixture is expected to be **blocked** under B3⁺, which the false-blocking analysis reports honestly rather than hides.

# Part G — Feasibility smoke-gate checklist (run these)

**No v0.5, no sealing, no confirmatory corpus until every in-scope gate passes on the pilot corpus.** Each gate is a minimal runnable test, not an experiment.

**Execution DAG (respect dependencies):**
```
G-1 / G-5 / G-8  →  G-6 / G-7  →  G-2 / G-4 / G-11  →  G-12 / G-13  →  G-9 / G-14  →  G-10
```
G-3 (latency spike) may run any time after G-1, but its threshold is fixed beforehand. **Claim-dependent gates** (G-3 latency, G-14 replay/DPoP, G-15 F4/F5, and the INV-only check) run **only** for claims retained in the sealed scope; a deferred claim's gate is marked deferred and must not contradict that deferral.

### G.1 Feasibility spikes (runnable immediately)

| Gate | Runs | Pass criterion | Blocks |
|------|------|----------------|--------|
| **G-1** | Import the Python Biscuit library; mint `C_0` (`P_0`); append one block → `P_1`; verify against the root **public** key only; confirm **(F)** prefix commitments are **stable** under append and agree between signer and verifier, and **(G′)** the **terminal** commitment **changes** under append — commitments per the §A.0.1 **BlockID commitment scheme** (ADR 0003), not raw prefix bytes | Round-trips and verifies with `κ_pub` alone; `commit_prefix(P_0)` identical before and after append; signer-side and verifier-side commitments agree **across a separate-process verifier**; terminal commitment differs after a post-hoc append, so `INV.capability_hash` rejects it; **commitment is encoding-independent** (a semantically equivalent container re-encoding yields the same commitment); **fail-closed** on unsupported commitment version and non-Ed25519 algorithms; API stable enough to script. *(Seal terminality is not a criterion: this design never seals — ADR 0002. G-1 is CONDITIONAL PASS until the ADR 0003 corrective suite passes — status on the smoke board.)* | IA-1; whole capability track |
| **G-3** *(claim: latency)* | Sign/verify 1,000 HTC+INV pairs (Ed25519); time boundary verification | Median below the **externally fixed** G-3 smoke threshold (set before measuring) | IA-3; the "lightweight" claim |
| **G-5** | Issue/verify a DPoP-bound (cnf/jkt) token; proof over method+URI; reject a wrong-holder proof | As stated | IA-5; DPoP arm and H4a |
| **G-8** | Canonicalize identical arguments on signer and verifier via RFC 8785 JCS; compare digests | Byte-identical | IA-8; invocation binding (T-args) |

### G.2 Construct-validity gates (interposition; before the authorizer/mutation gates)

| Gate | Runs | Pass criterion | Blocks |
|------|------|----------------|--------|
| **G-6** | Interpose the boundary in the MCP SDK tool-call path; attempt a bypass | No tool call executes without passing the boundary and emitting a `MediationEvent` | IA-6; construct validity of every result |
| **G-7** | Interpose the effect ledger + `ToolIngressEvent` recorder at the tool; execute one call; read both back | Both recorded independently of any SUT self-report; `correlation_id` matches the harness-minted value | IA-7; the independent oracle, all F-predicates |

### G.3 Authorizer, provisioning, HTC gates (require the Part F fixes)

| Gate | Runs | Pass criterion | Blocks |
|------|------|----------------|--------|
| **G-2** | Freeze and hash `Γ` (`H(Γ)`). (a) appended widening fact — verifies cryptographically **and** leaves `C_i ⊆ C_{i−1}`; (b) third-party block / `trusting {attacker_key}` — **rejected** as out of profile; (c) `Γ` mutation broadening trust — detected via `H(Γ)`; (d) `−attenuation` control admits what full B3 blocks. Block identity and prefix commitments here are those of ADR 0003 / §A.0.1 (`BlockID_i`, `commit_prefix`), so G-2's `Allowed(P_i)` computation and G-1's commitment scheme cannot drift apart | (a)–(d) all hold; every `C_i` computed over `Ω` by the frozen `Γ`, not asserted | IA-2; the entire F1 prevention claim |
| **G-4** | RFC 8693 exchange under the pinned AS profile yielding `C_i`; verify OAuth-resource ∩ capability effective authority, `actor→holder` mapping, `INV.access_token_hash` | Task-narrowed token issues; both layers enforced; actor mapping resolves | IA-4; B2-exchange-task and the fair-baseline claim |
| **G-11** | HTC mutations: wrong-signer, parent-swap, child-swap, depth-rollback, capability-swap, terminal-key-mismatch, domain-tag confusion (HTC bytes replayed as INV), expired/`nbf`-violating cert; **plus the commitment-layer mutations: block reordering, truncation, container re-encoding, missing HTC coverage, unsupported commitment version, unsupported algorithm** | Each **rejected**; the valid chain (including the `n=0` zero-hop case) passes. Commitment-layer status: reordering, truncation, re-encoding, coverage, version, and algorithm rejection are already **[VERIFIED]** at the commitment layer by the ADR 0003 regression suite (tests 1–8); G-11 proper re-tests them through the full HTC/INV verifier once implemented | IA (HTC correctness); H4a |

### G.4 Oracle-independence and matched-authority gates

| Gate | Runs | Pass criterion | Blocks |
|------|------|----------------|--------|
| **G-12** | Fault-injected SUT reporting a **wrong** self-verdict while the ledger records the true effect; plus correlation-ID swap/drop/duplicate/concurrency injection | The oracle's `admission_breach`/`realized_harm`/`log_integrity_failure` and the correlation-ID checks detect every discrepancy **without** reading any SUT verdict or SUT digest | oracle independence; every security result |
| **G-13** | Assert `Allowed(AT_i) = C_i` for every hop and every strong baseline; assert each realizes the same `C_0→…→C_n` on F1-root/terminal/chain-tamper (chain-tamper NA where no chain) | Equalities hold; no strong baseline differs in authority granularity | matched fairness; the whole comparison |

### G.5 Claim-dependent replay/DPoP and reference-monitor gates

| Gate | Runs | Pass criterion | Blocks |
|------|------|----------------|--------|
| **G-9** | Fire N concurrent bit-identical requests at the replay cache **across processes**; induce a backend error | Exactly one proceeds; no double-admission; fail-closed observed; frozen `(mechanism_tag, jti)`/TTL/capacity budget | IA-9; B3⁺ and the replay layer |
| **G-14** *(claim: replay/DPoP)* | Attach the same authenticated-ID cache to B2-DPoP and B3; run the four-way DPoP taxonomy | Both block `captured-proof-replay` identically; INV-only blocks `first-use-body-mutation` while the replay cache alone does not; bare bearer cannot carry the cache | the DPoP/INV attribution |
| **G-15** *(claim: F4/F5)* | Verify F4/F5 comparisons run only among B3+ablations **or** with the same reference monitor on OAuth arms, via `authz_context_hash` | No cross-mechanism F4/F5 claim rests on a monitor-configuration difference | F4/F5 fairness |

### G.6 Final pilot integration gate

| Gate | Runs | Pass criterion | Blocks |
|------|------|----------------|--------|
| **G-10** *(last)* | End-to-end pilot: the benign running example through B0 and B3, producing `ObservedRequest`, `MediationEvent`, `ToolIngressEvent`, `EffectEvent`, and independent `reference_allow`/`observed_forwarded`/`admission_breach`/`realized_harm`/`false_block` | Green; oracle uses only raw evidence + sealed `IntendedInvocation` + trusted mediation/ledger; every prior DAG gate passed | readiness to author the confirmatory corpus |

### Gate-outcome policy (fallbacks; record each as an ADR entry)

- **G-1/G-2 fail** (Python Biscuit unusable or non-monotone in practice) → fallback to a Macaroon-style caveat chain (symmetric HMAC; verifier holds the root secret — **losing** the root-public-key property, update §C) or FFI to the Rust `biscuit-auth` library.
- **G-4 fails** → build a behaviourally faithful AS enforcing the mandated checks directly; disclose it.
- **G-6 or G-7 fail** → construct validity of the whole study is at risk; **re-architect interposition before any confirmatory work.** Highest priority.
- **G-13 fails** (cannot realize per-hop `C_i` equally) → mark the affected baseline, never silently mis-provision.

# Part H — Freeze, seal loop, and confirmatory campaign [DESIGN, E9]

**Order (MUST).**
1. Implement, debug, and run the Part G gates on the **pilot** corpus only.
2. Freeze hypotheses, oracle predicates, baseline configurations, latency estimands, and the **equivalence margin** (separate from, and set after, the G-3 smoke threshold; both fixed before any confirmatory result).
3. Freeze and hash the **v0.5 candidate**: design document, implementation commit, oracle code, analysis code, all configuration (`Ω`, `Γ` with `H(Γ)`, identity-plane registry, `task_authorization_policy`, allowed-sink policy), the pinned dependency environment **including the operating system and its exact version/build — the sealed measurement platform (ADR 0014; `docs/frozen_parameters.md` row 9)**, and the **corpus generator** — its code, the deterministic key seeds for every principal, the seed→keypair derivation rule, and the scenario specifications, the sealed inputs from which the confirmatory corpus is deterministically produced. The seal covers **generators and seeds, never pre-minted token bytes** (ADR 0007; note below).
4. Run the corpus generator under the fixed rule to produce the confirmatory corpus. *Update, 2026-08-02 — amended by **ADR 0037**, recorded rather than silently rewritten. This step read “produce the confirmatory corpus **(including the held-out third)**” until this date.* **The confirmatory corpus is now a SINGLE SET with no held-out third.** The split machinery was never built and is **cancelled, not deferred**: building it was scheduled for the block that also had to complete the §E.4 subcases, and a held-out third that is generated but never analysed protects nothing while still costing a third of the instances. **What this forfeits is stated in §J.5 item 23 rather than left to a reader** — pre-registration and a held-out subset defend against different threats, and only the first survives. Restoring the arm would require a new ADR, the machinery, and re-opening this step; after the confirmatory run it could not be done at all.
5. Verify **disjointness** of pilot and confirmatory corpora (no shared scenario file; assert on **scenario-specification and seed content hashes**, never on token bytes, which differ across mints even for the same logical scenario — ADR 0007).
6. Emit a **detached** manifest (never written into a file it hashes; add a public temporal anchor — OpenTimestamps and/or an OSF registration — plus a signed git commit to a public remote), then perform the **final seal**.
7. Execute the frozen campaign **once**.

**Token non-reproducibility note [ADR 0007].** Biscuit tokens are **not byte-reproducible across
mints**: the format uses a single-use ephemeral block key per append, so two mints of the same
logical capability differ in bytes **[VERIFIED, gate G-1 corrective pass]**. Step 3 therefore
seals scenario specifications, deterministic key seeds, and the generator — tokens are minted at
campaign runtime from those sealed inputs. Determinism is unaffected: every oracle verdict is a
function of `C_n = Allowed(P_n; Γ, κ, Ω)` and the sealed scenario, never of token bytes (§A.0.1,
§F.1, Part I), and `INV.capability_hash` is computed over the runtime-presented token's BlockID
commitment (§F.2, ADR 0003). **Seed-disclosure warning [DESIGN]:** publishing the corpus seeds
publishes every private key derived from them; the corpus is a testbed artifact only and its keys
MUST NOT be reused in any deployment — a binding obligation on the corpus generator when it is
written.

**What "once" means (MUST).** It governs the deterministic **security** verdicts: each sealed scenario is evaluated once for its verdict; no scenario is re-run to obtain a different verdict. It does **not** forbid the pre-registered **latency** repetitions (a random quantity), which are part of the single campaign.

**Abort / infrastructure / rerun / unseal rules (MUST).**
- **Abort** (crash, resource exhaustion) → discard the partial run in full; report no partial security results; re-run the **same** sealed artifacts. An abort is not a result and does not count as the "once."
- **Infrastructure failure vs finding** → a failure attributable to infrastructure (harness bug, ledger outage, environment drift) is logged in a deviations record; fixing infrastructure that does **not** touch sealed design/oracle/config/corpus does **not** require a reseal, but the fix commit and its hash are appended before re-running.
- **Any change to sealed design, oracle, config, or corpus → full unseal/reseal**: bump the candidate version, re-hash all artifacts, regenerate the manifest, record the reason; the previous seal and its results are marked superseded and are **not** cherry-picked.
- **No result-driven tuning** after the final seal; only disclosed infrastructure fixes are permitted.

**Statistical protocol [D26].**
- **Security and blocking outcomes** are reported as **exact counts and rates only** — `blocked/total`, attack-success count, false-block count, per-family exact results, at both class-macro (per family) and instance-micro (per instance) granularity, with template-derived variants clustered. **No confidence interval** is placed on any security/blocking proportion (a fixed author-constructed suite has no random-sampling population; verdicts are deterministic). Repetition of a security verdict is used **only** to detect nondeterminism.
- **Latency** is the **only** quantity with repeated sampling and confidence intervals (a genuine random quantity): micro-benchmarks ≥ ~1,000 timed iterations per configuration; end-to-end ≥ ~200 per configuration across ≥ 3 independent batches; report median, p95, IQR/bootstrap CI; **decompose** into setup / delegation / boundary-verification / end-to-end; report **cold and warm** separately; randomize/interleave or Latin-square counterbalance condition order within each batch; discard warm-up; persistent TLS and Ed25519 keep handshakes and signature randomness out of the measured path. Absolute overhead is the **primary** result; the fraction-of-one-LLM-turn (against both a full-turn and a conservative TTFT denominator) is a **secondary** interpretive aid. The "lightweight" claim is pre-registered as **retracted** if the absolute added boundary-verification latency of B3 over B0 exceeds the equivalence margin.

**Held-out and generalization.** The held-out third is author-constructed but sealed before B3 implementation; describe it as **sealed parameterized instances not used for post-result tuning**, and limit the generalization claim to unseen instances within the threat model. A supervisor- or third-party-sourced held-out set (for a stronger claim) is deferred to the conference extension.

# Part I — Independent oracle predicates (executable)

Each reads only raw evidence, sealed `IntendedInvocation`, and the trusted mediation/ledger records. Reported quantities are **separated**: `reference_allow`, `observed_forwarded`, `admission_breach`, `realized_harm`, `false_block`, plus `log_integrity_failure`. `H_JCS` below is the frozen construction of ADR 0009 (defined in §F.2; oracle-side implementation `src/harness/oracle/jcs_digest.py`).

```python
def effects_of(led, cid):      return [e for e in led if e.correlation_id == cid]
def mediation_of(med, cid):    return next((m for m in med if m.correlation_id == cid), None)

# (0) REFERENCE DECISION — what a correct monitor SHOULD do, from sealed truth only
def reference_allow(intent):
    return intent.R <= intent.C_sets[-1]           # R ⊆ C_n (plus family-specific gates in the fixture)

# (1) OBSERVED FORWARDING — did the boundary admit, per the trusted mediation record (NOT the SUT)
def observed_forwarded(med, cid):
    m = mediation_of(med, cid);  return bool(m and m.admitted)

# (2) ADMISSION BREACH — boundary admitted something the reference says it should not
def admission_breach(intent, med, cid):
    return observed_forwarded(med, cid) and not reference_allow(intent)

# (3) REALIZED HARM — an actual effect violated the family predicate (over the effect SET)
def realized_harm_F1(intent, led, cid):
    A = authority_from_effects(effects_of(led, cid))
    return not A <= intent.C_sets[-1]              # A ⊄ C_n

def realized_harm_F2(intent, cred_result, led, cid):
    ok = cred_result.principal_verified and cred_result.principal == intent.oauth_actor
    return (not ok) and len(effects_of(led, cid)) > 0

def realized_harm_F3(intent, obs, led, cid):
    oracle_digest = H_JCS(obs.raw_arguments)       # oracle-computed, independent (ADR 0009)
    for e in effects_of(led, cid):
        if e.effect_request_digest != intent.intended_request_digest: return True
        if e.effect_request_digest != oracle_digest:                  return True   # never compare
        if (e.tool, e.audience) != (intent.tool, intent.audience):    return True   # effect vs a
    return False                                                                    # tampered-only digest

def realized_harm_F4(intent, obs, led, cid):
    for e in effects_of(led, cid):
        if e.recipient is not None:
            for lbl in e.data_labels_touched:
                if is_sensitive(lbl) and not valid_declassification(obs, lbl, e): return True
    return False

def realized_harm_F5(led, obs, cid):
    for e in effects_of(led, cid):
        if is_high_risk(e.action) and not valid_approval_binds(obs.approval_artifact, e): return True
    return False

# (4) FALSE BLOCK — a legitimate (benign) request was not forwarded
def false_block(intent, med, cid, is_benign):
    return is_benign and reference_allow(intent) and not observed_forwarded(med, cid)

# cross-cutting: boundary reported blocked but an effect occurred
def log_integrity_failure(med, led, cid):
    m = mediation_of(med, cid)
    return bool(m and not m.admitted and len(effects_of(led, cid)) > 0)
```

**No-/partial-/multi-effect handling (MUST).** Every `realized_harm_*` is over the **set** of correlated effects: zero effects ⇒ no realized harm; a partial effect that still violates ⇒ realized harm; multiple effects ⇒ realized harm if **any** violates. `admission_breach` (a decision property) and `realized_harm` (an effect property) are reported **separately** for every family, as are `reference_allow`, `observed_forwarded`, and `false_block`. F3 always compares the sealed-intended, the independently-observed, and the actual-effect digests; it never compares an effect only against a possibly-tampered observed digest.

**Unscorable cells (MUST) [DESIGN, ADR 0042 — definition added 2026-08-06; the machinery was built and tested under ADRs 0038/0039/0040].** A cell the campaign cannot judge soundly is routed to an `unscorable` list with its cause recorded, and is never a verdict. Three causes exist: (i) the runner raised before a complete record existed (`RunnerError`); (ii) the wall-clock straddle — the cell's artifact was minted at one instant and judged more than `Δ` from it, so the cell measures campaign scheduling rather than the mechanism (one clock per cell); (iii) a credential whose validity window does not cover the judging instant. An unscorable cell is not a block, not a `false_block`, and not a result at all, exactly as an `NA` cell is not; the results chapter reports every unscorable cell with its cause (`src/harness/campaign.py`).

# Part J — Standard scientific workflow: what to prepare besides this document

This section is the checklist of preparation that a rigorous computer-security-systems study needs **around** the code, so that the artifact is credible, reproducible, and paper-ready. Ordered by when it is needed.

## J.1 Before writing any code (this week)

1. **Repository skeleton + hygiene.** One repo; `src/` (sut, harness), `fixtures/pilot/`, `fixtures/confirmatory/` (empty until Part H step 4), `analysis/`, `docs/` (this file), `adr/` (decision records). MIT/Apache license, `.editorconfig`, pre-commit hooks (formatter, linter). A repo that is clean from commit 1 is far cheaper than retrofitting.
2. **Pinned, reproducible environment.** `pyproject.toml` + a **locked** resolver file (`uv.lock` or `requirements.lock` with hashes); a `Dockerfile` (or devcontainer) that pins the Python version and every dependency; record OS and CPU in a `hardware_profile`. Reproducibility is graded at top venues via artifact evaluation — this is not optional for the conference path.
3. **Determinism controls.** Fix `PYTHONHASHSEED`; a single seed source threaded through the harness; Ed25519 (deterministic) for all signing; canonical JSON (RFC 8785 JCS) everywhere a digest is taken. Document them in one place.
4. **ADR log started.** One short markdown per decision (context, decision, status, consequences). Every Part G fallback and every seal-time parameter becomes an ADR. This is your audit trail against "PARKing" (deciding after seeing results).
5. **A written threat model + assumptions page** (you already have the substance in Parts A/D) as a standalone `docs/threat_model.md`, including the explicit out-of-scope list, so an examiner sees the boundary is deliberate.

## J.2 During smoke tests (Part G)

6. **A smoke-test report per gate.** For each gate: what ran, the observed result, pass/fail, and — if it changed a design choice — the ADR it produced. This becomes the "feasibility" subsection of the dissertation and pre-empts the "did you actually verify your library assumptions?" question.
7. **CI that runs the gates.** Even a minimal GitHub Actions workflow running `pytest` on every push protects against silent regressions and is itself evidence of engineering rigor for artifact evaluation.
8. **A harness-self-test suite** (tests of the *oracle*, not the SUT): hand-labelled traces where you know the right answer, plus the fault-injection tests (G-12). The oracle must be tested independently of the system it judges.
9. **Fix the seal-time parameters and record them, unset, now:** the equivalence margin (from external engineering need, before timing), the freshness window Δ, the context-label→outcome policy, the `task_authorization_policy`, the reference LLM-turn denominators. Put them in a `docs/frozen_parameters.md` with each value's justification; fill values before Part H step 3. *Update, 2026-07-31: all of these are now settled — rows 1/2/7 by ADR 0025/0026, row 3 by ADR 0027, rows 4/6/10 by ADR 0022/0023, and the `task_authorization_policy` (row 5) is **deferred by decision** (ADR 0028) rather than filled. Only row 9 remains, and it is read off the measurement box at seal time.* **A constraint `Δ` imposes on the F3/F5 fixture work, recorded here because that work will read this item:** `Δ` governs the `jti` cache TTL, the DPoP proof `iat` window **and INV freshness at the boundary**, so the `F3 dpop-captured-proof-replay` fixture **MUST be constructed within `Δ`**. Built outside it, `B3` would block the replay on freshness rather than admitting it, collapsing the `B3` = A / `B3⁺` = B distinction that is `B3⁺`'s entire reason to exist — and collapsing it in the direction that flatters this work's hypothesis. Fixed in advance so it cannot become a post-hoc fixture adjustment (§E.4 note; ADR 0027 Consequences).

## J.3 Before sealing (Part H)

10. **Pre-registration document** (you already have `PRE_REGISTRATION.md`; update it to this consolidated design: the frozen-benchmark thesis, RQ1–4, H4a/H4b, the per-family predicates, the descriptive-statistics rule, the latency protocol, the sealing/temporal-anchor procedure). Seal it with the detached manifest + OpenTimestamps/OSF + signed commit. *(Amended 2026-08-06, ADR 0042: this item originally named "H1–H9/H4a-b", but this document defines no hypotheses numbered H1–H9 — Part D.1's falsifiable content is exactly H4a and H4b. The list now names what is defined; no hypotheses were invented to fit the old numbering.)*
11. **Corpus generator + disjointness check** as code, not by hand, so the confirmatory corpus is deterministically regenerable and provably disjoint from pilot.
12. **Analysis code frozen with the rest.** Every table/figure regenerated from `results/raw/` by one command (`make reproduce`); no manual spreadsheet steps. Freeze it in the seal so results cannot be massaged post hoc. **Pooling rule, fixed in advance [DESIGN, ADR 0026]:** the `gt-f1-chain-tamper` cell is **excluded from every per-arm mean**. On that scenario the exchange arms (`B2-exchange-broad`, `B2-exchange-task`, `B2-exchange-task-DPoP`) perform a **failed AS round trip and receive no token**, while the capability arms (`B-cap`, `B3`, `B3⁺`) do purely local work — so pooling it would average a network refusal together with local cryptography, and would do so **asymmetrically across the ladder**, inflating exactly the arms whose online round trip the study is trying to isolate. **Refusal-path latency is reported as its own series**, never folded into a benign per-arm mean nor into `frozen_parameters` row 1's estimand. Fixed here, before any measurement, so it cannot become a post-hoc exclusion; this is a **plan**, and nothing has been measured.

## J.4 During and after the confirmatory campaign

13. **A deviations log** (`DEVIATIONS.md`): any departure from the pre-registration, dated, with reason; abort/rerun events; infrastructure fixes and their hashes. Reviewers trust a study that reports its deviations far more than one that appears flawless.
14. **Raw traces are immutable and archived.** `results/raw/` is write-once; back it up (e.g., a release artifact or Zenodo DOI for the conference version). Tables/figures are pure functions of it.
15. **An artifact-evaluation-ready package**: README with exact reproduction steps, the container, the locked environment, `make reproduce`, and a mapping from each paper claim → the script that regenerates its number. This is the concrete deliverable USENIX/S&P/CCS/NDSS artifact evaluation asks for; preparing it incrementally is far cheaper than at the end.

## J.5 Supervision and external validity (ongoing)

16. **A supervisor-facing one-page status** kept current: which gates passed, which decisions are frozen, what is deferred to the conference version. Prof. Raza's earlier guidance (seminal sources, tight scope) applies to the write-up; keep the design/claim scope honest with him as gates resolve.
17. **A monthly literature re-check** (the 2026 preprint stream is fast): before sealing and again before submission, re-verify no published work has closed the measurement gap or invalidated a "first controlled comparison" qualifier, and update positioning. Never let "first/novel" stand unqualified.
18. **Independent held-out (conference only).** Arrange, if feasible, for the supervisor or a third party to contribute a held-out scenario set for the conference extension, so the generalization claim can be strengthened beyond author-constructed instances.
19. **Platform-bound ledger enforcement — a reproducibility/validity threat, recorded [DESIGN, ADR 0014].** The effect ledger's independence enforcement is Win32 share-mode locking, so the confirmatory campaign and its seal are bound to Windows, and third-party re-verification of gate G-7 requires a Windows machine until the deferred POSIX variant (planned after submission, before any artifact-evaluated conference version) passes the same five G-7 checks — until then **no cross-platform claim is made anywhere**. Two tamper-evidence properties with **different guarantors**, never conflated: campaign-time integrity is guaranteed by the live exclusive file handle (G-7); post-campaign integrity is guaranteed by the Part H seal (content hashes, detached manifest, public temporal anchor).
20. **In-process A2A adapter — a construct-validity threat, recorded [DESIGN, ADR 0020].** The delegation hop runs behind a port (`src/sut/protocol/a2a.py`) whose only adapter in this phase is in-process: no wire transport or serialization, no task lifecycle or `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` credential flow, no A2A error codes, and the observed `raw_arguments` bytes are the canonical serialization of the presented mapping rather than captured wire bytes. ADR 0004's pin-after-gate rule keeps `a2a-python` out until an A2A gate exists — and **Part G defines none**, an enumeration gap recorded in ADR 0020 for the author to resolve rather than closed by inventing a gate. No conclusion about A2A *transport* behaviour may be drawn from runs on this adapter; the benchmark's authorization-propagation measurements ride the envelope contents and boundary checks, which the port preserves. The SDK-backed adapter, when its gate exists and passes, replaces one constructor call site at the composition root — arms, agents, and boundary code are unaffected by construction. **Addition, 2026-07-30 (EXP2 STEP 7):** a consequence of the same divergence needs recording for **G-12**. `ObservedRequest.raw_arguments` is presently a *canonical re-serialization* of the arguments mapping observed at the mediation boundary, not bytes captured off a wire — with an in-process adapter there are no wire bytes to capture, so this is harmless today. But Part I's `realized_harm_F3` deliberately compares **three** digests (sealed-intended, independently-observed, actual-effect) precisely so that a *tampered observation* is caught, and that comparison is only meaningful if the observed bytes are the bytes as observed rather than a re-encoding the harness produced. Once an SDK-backed adapter exists, `raw_arguments` MUST become the captured bytes. Flagged here for the G-12 task specification; no code change in this pass. **Update, 2026-08-02 (EXP7 STEP 9) — gate G-12 has since PASSED and did NOT close this; both halves of item 20 remain LIVE construct-validity threats at seal time.** The forward pointer above is recorded as discharged-to-a-gate, and a reader could take a green G-12 for a closed item, so the outcome is written down rather than left to inference. G-12 settled the question it was asked — whether `realized_harm_F3` is still meaningful today — and answered *yes, because the **sealed** digest is the anchor and RFC 8785 only normalizes differences it declares non-semantic*, so a tampered observation is caught by the sealed-vs-effect comparison even when the observed digest is a re-encoding. What G-12 did **not** do, and did not claim to, is make `raw_arguments` the captured bytes: with an in-process adapter there are none to capture. **So the obligation stands unchanged** — an SDK-backed adapter must bring captured wire bytes with it — and it now has **no gate assigned**, because the gate it was flagged to has passed. It belongs in the dissertation's construct-validity section in these terms: *the observed request bytes are the harness's canonical re-serialization of what the boundary saw, not bytes off a wire; the three-digest comparison is anchored on the sealed digest, which no runtime principal can reach, so the F3 result holds — but no claim is made about wire-level observation fidelity.* Likewise ADR 0020's first half stays open on its own terms: **Part G still defines no A2A gate**, so the enumeration gap ADR 0020 records is unclosed, and no conclusion about A2A *transport* behaviour may be drawn from any run in this study.

21. **Task-to-principal authorization is out of scope and unmeasured — a validity threat, recorded [DESIGN, ADR 0028].** This study makes **no claim** about task-to-principal authorization enforcement. A deployment binding tasks to authorized principals may block cases this benchmark does not score, and **the absence of a `wrong_principal` result must not be read as evidence that any arm fails to handle it**. An unscored family is a limit on what was measured, not a finding about the mechanisms. The reason is that `frozen_parameters` row 5 has no anchor outside the author's judgement, so freezing it would have produced a number measuring conformance to an artifact this author invented; reporting nothing is more honest than reporting something ungrounded. §E.4's row reads *deferred — unscored*, and the three retained `F2` subfamilies — which are where `B2-DPoP` and `B3` are distinguished on holder binding — are scored in full. **Two obligations fall due before Part H step 3 and are recorded, not discharged:** `PRE_REGISTRATION.md` must state the deferral, its reason and its scope; and the **WHOLE CONFIRMATORY CORPUS must be scanned to confirm it contains no `wrong_principal` variant**, because an instance of a deferred subfamily surviving there would be scored against a policy that does not exist, or silently dropped at analysis time *after the results are visible*. *Update, 2026-08-02 — **ADR 0037** cut the held-out third, and this obligation names the object that was cut. It is **re-pointed, not lapsed**: it now covers the entire confirmatory corpus and remains a **pre-seal** obligation. An obligation that expires because the object it named was removed is exactly how a deferred family re-enters scoring unnoticed.* Neither document exists yet; both checks belong at seal time, when they can still change something.

22. **`B3⁺`'s replay cache is measured single-process only — a scope limit, recorded [DESIGN, ADR 0034].** Gate **G-9** establishes that the §F.5 check-and-insert is **sound under multi-process concurrency**, and it establishes that **about the arbiter** (`src/sut/replay_arbiter/`, reached through `RemoteJtiCache`): exactly one of N concurrent bit-identical requests proceeds, the induced backend error denies, overflow fails closed. The **ladder's `B3⁺` is a different object**: it carries its own in-process `JtiCache`, one per arm instance, so across two SUT processes the bit-identical replay it is built to block is **admitted**. EXP5's standing check measured both. **A green G-9 therefore does not license the statement "the ladder arm has multi-process atomicity," and the dissertation must not make it.** What is claimed is what is measured: in a **single-process** campaign — the configuration ADR 0034 fixes and the one §E.4's `F3 dpop-captured-proof-replay` cell was predicted for — `B3⁺` blocks the in-`Δ` replay that `B3` admits, and that single cell is `B3⁺`'s reason to exist. **A multi-process deployment would need the arbiter, and this study does not measure that configuration.** The deferral is a decision rather than an absence: `RemoteJtiCache` exists, is tested, and is a drop-in for `JtiCache` through the `attach_replay_cache` seam gate G-14 already uses, so wiring it is one construction — deliberately not done here, because it would put a loopback round trip inside ADR 0026's measured segment for exactly one arm and report an apparatus difference as a mechanism difference in RQ4. `src/harness/campaign.py` refuses a confirmatory multi-process run while this holds, keyed on the seam so the constraint lifts by itself when a baseline reaches the arbiter.

23. **Instance-selection bias is unmitigated — a validity threat, recorded [DESIGN, ADR 0037].** Pre-registration and a held-out subset defend against **different** threats, and only one survives the decision to cut the held-out third. **Pre-registration** seals the design, the predicates, the thresholds and the analysis before the confirmatory run, so the analysis cannot be chosen after seeing the results; that protection is **unaffected** and remains in force. **A held-out subset** would additionally have addressed **instance-selection bias** — the risk that an author-constructed suite contains instances the mechanisms were, consciously or not, built to catch. **That protection is forfeited, and no other part of the design substitutes for it.** Partial mitigations exist and **must be reported as partial, never as replacements**: the mechanisms and the frozen parameters were fixed before most scenarios were written; every gate criterion had to be **shown able to fail**; and §E.4's expected matrix was written in advance, so a disagreement between a cell and a measurement is recorded as a finding rather than reconciled. This is a limitation of **what was measured**, not a property of the mechanisms, and RQ3's answer is qualified accordingly wherever it appears.

## J.6 What is explicitly NOT part of smoke tests (do not start)

Second MCP server, multiple resource domains, delegation-depth sweep, official AIP comparator run, adaptive attacks, the full ingestion-time signed-label model, and the independently sourced held-out set are **conference/journal extensions**, defined on the same interfaces so no P0/P1 work is discarded, but **not** to be built during the smoke-test phase.

## J.7 The §K LLM-in-the-loop demonstration — outside Parts A–J, outside the seal [DESIGN, ADR 0010]

The research proposal's single qualitative demonstration (a real LLM agent and a poisoned MCP tool in the golden-thread example, under B0 and B3 only) is retained but exists **outside Parts A–J and outside the seal**: it is qualitative, produces no counts, rates, or statistics, may never enter a results table, is not part of the sealed corpus or the single confirmatory campaign, and running it can never trigger an unseal. The deterministic-mock design remains the sole basis for every measured result (pre-registered reason: it removes LLM sampling as a confound). It is reported with explicit limitations under external validity; if the schedule does not permit it before the 11 September submission, it is dropped and the dissertation records the scope change and its reason — never silently omitted. `[ADR 0010]`

---

## Appendix — Honest open status (not resolved; not required for the smoke-test step)

1. **Python Biscuit maturity (IA-1/IA-2)** — format production-used but **not formally audited**, which remains an open, disclosed limitation. The specific library's fitness is no longer open: `biscuit-python==0.4.0` passed G-1 (IA-1) and G-2 (IA-2, under the ADR 0016 freeze), each scoped to that exact pin.
2. **Complete mediation in the MCP SDK (IA-6)** — depends on SDK internals not yet inspected.
3. **Independent effect-ledger interposition (IA-7)** — the core of construct validity; unverified until G-7.
4. **Equivalence margin value** — fixed from external engineering need before timing; not chosen here.
5. **Conference-model label provenance** — MSc narrows F4 to pre-labelled payloads; full model defined, not built.
6. **Independent held-out authorship** — author-constructed for the MSc; third-party set deferred.
7. **AIP comparator** — no official run; feature-matched table only for the MSc.

None is described as done. They are the agenda between here and a sealed v0.5, and between an MSc submission and a conference paper.

---

*End of consolidated Experiment Architecture (implementation candidate). Part G is run along the DAG; work stops and the fallback applies at any failing gate; the confirmatory corpus is neither authored nor executed here; v0.5 is not generated. Nothing here is sealed, and no implementation assumption is a verified fact until its gate passes.*
