# Project Rules — Overview & Working Rules

## What this is
Trustworthy Agentic Communication: a pre-registered, reproducible testbed that measures authorization-scope propagation and its cost at the A2A→MCP boundary (the cross-protocol confused-deputy problem, TV23). MSc Cybersecurity dissertation, University of Glasgow.

## Authoritative design
`docs/EXPERIMENT_ARCHITECTURE_FINAL.md` is the SINGLE source of truth (baselines, capability/HTC/INV, oracle, smoke-gate DAG, freeze/seal loop, workflow). Do not contradict it. If a change is needed, record an ADR in `adr/` and update the doc — never silently diverge.

## Current phase
Experimental apparatus, pilot corpus only. **Thirteen smoke gates pass** (`smoke/README.md`); the
golden thread runs end to end — Supervisor → A2A hop (behind a port, ADR 0020) → Specialist → MCP
tool call over the frozen `Ω`, **in-process or in a spawned SUT child process**, the two modes
measured identical over all 32 applicable nine-arm cells. All nine §E.1 ladder arms are built. Since 2026-08-01 the study
**scores four of the five §E.3 families**: F1 (three subcases), three F2 subfamilies, **F3** (the
expired-token and captured-proof-replay rows, over all nine arms), and **F4/F5** (four labelled
fixtures — two attacks and two benign controls — over all nine arms under **both** monitor
configurations). **ADR 0030 closed ADR 0009's last category (c) fields**, so `payload_digest`,
`authz_context_hash` and `label_assertions_digest` have constructions and the boundary-owned
`ContextApprovalMonitor` verifies all three artifact types. **Gate G-15 PASSES**, and its residual
is a *result*, not a limitation: with the shared monitor F4/F5 measure the **monitor**, not the
mechanism — and without one, `B3`/`B3⁺` refuse the benign controls too, so the capability policy
plane is useful **only when a monitor is configured**. Two §E.4 drafting errors on `B-cap` were
adjudicated into **ADR 0031** (`NA → B` on the F3 OAuth controls) and **ADR 0032** (`A† → A` on
F4/F5); both corrected **predictions**, never code. The pilot corpus now carries **two authority
chains** — F4/F5 run on one where their actions are inside `C_1`, or `containment_ok` would mask
the policy conjuncts. **9 of 11 `frozen_parameters` rows are set**; row 5 is deferred by decision
(ADR 0028) and only row 9 remains, read off the measurement box at seal time. Since 2026-08-02 the
SUT runs **out of process** — both agents, the arm and the arm's decision in a spawned child, with
the runner, the mediation record, the ledger writer, the effector, the oracle and every sealed
object in the parent — so G-6's and G-7's in-process reachability residuals are closed by **address
space** rather than by assumption; **in-process stays the default**, so the earlier gates are not
silently re-adjudicated. **Gates G-12, G-9 and G-14 PASS** and **`IA-9` moves to verified** (ADR
0033: the replay cache is a single-writer arbiter process). G-14's attribution belongs in the
results chapter: **DPoP and invocation binding block different things** — indistinguishable on
captured-proof-replay given the same cache, separated on first-use body mutation, the residual
credited to **INV**. Only **G-3 and G-10** remain; `IA-3` is untouched. Pre-registration still a
stub; `fixtures/confirmatory/` still empty; **no timing number has been measured or reported
anywhere**. Rows 1 and 2 being SET does **not** authorize measurement: G-3 owns timing and ADR 0025
requires an adjudicative run on the row 9 sealed platform, which is not yet locked.
Since 2026-08-02 the study **can score itself**: all **ten** Part I predicates exist (seven were
built in one pass; before that five existed, every one a by-product of G-12, and the F1/F4/F5
matrix cells were the arm's own `(admitted, reason_code)` read back). `src/harness/campaign.py` is
the single campaign entry point over the existing stack, and the pilot matrix is now produced
**from oracle verdicts**, agreeing with §E.4 in all 32 applicable cells. `analysis/` holds the
pre-registered statistical procedure Part H step 3 seals — exact counts with **no** interval on the
security side (§E.5: a fixed author-constructed suite has no random-sampling population), and
ADR 0026's *stands*/*retracted* rule with a 95% bootstrap CI on the latency side, exercised on
**synthetic** samples on both sides of the 20 ms margin. The estimator has seen **no** real
measurement and the campaign records the timing seams as **names, not durations**.
*(Update notes, each true when written and superseded by the next: (1) "Repository skeleton,
pre-smoke-test. Implementation logic has NOT begun" — 2026-07-30; (2) "under `B0` and `B3` (the
other seven arms are not built)"; (3) "four arms are built", G-13's two limbs open, rows 1–2 UNSET;
(4) "Nine smoke gates pass … F3, F4 and F5 cannot be scored at all, because `authz_context_hash`
has been ADR 0009 category (c) since the beginning" — superseded by the ADR 0030 / G-15 pass,
2026-08-01; (5) "Eleven smoke gates pass … Gates G-3, G-9, G-10, G-12, G-14 remain; `IA-3` and
`IA-9` are both untouched" — superseded by the EXP5 process-separation block, 2026-08-02.)*

## Pre-registration status
Not yet authored. Per Part H, the pre-registration is written and sealed only AFTER the smoke gates pass, and is derived from the architecture doc. `docs/PRE_REGISTRATION.md` is a stub. Any earlier draft is superseded and must not be reused.

## Evidence grades (use these tags in code comments, docs, ADRs, commit bodies)
- [VERIFIED]      — checked against a primary source (RFC / protocol spec / Biscuit spec or FAQ).
- [DESIGN]        — a project decision; internally consistent, not externally mandated.
- [UNVERIFIED-IA] — a property a library/environment must have, not yet confirmed in code. NEVER state one as fact; each is gated by a smoke test (design Part F.4 / Part G).

## Red lines (do not cross without an explicit instruction from the author)
1. **DISCHARGED 2026-08-06 (ADR 0043).** Was: do NOT create or populate `fixtures/confirmatory/` before sealing (Part H); it stays empty. The corpus was generated at Part H **step 4**, which is after step 3's seal, so the rule was satisfied rather than broken — and it is recorded as discharged because a rule that reads as a live prohibition on work already done teaches the wrong thing to the next reader.
2. **PARTLY DISCHARGED.** All fifteen in-scope gates passed on the pilot corpus and the seal was taken twice (v0.5 `805425e`, v0.6 `cdf185d`). **The campaign half STANDS:** do NOT run a confirmatory campaign until the v0.7 reseal is complete (ADR 0044).
3. Gates G-2, G-6, G-7 are construct-validity life-or-death (Biscuit monotonicity under the frozen authorizer Γ; complete mediation; independent effect ledger). If any fails, STOP and apply the gate-outcome fallback; do not proceed on that branch.
4. The oracle NEVER reads a SUT-computed verdict or digest; it recomputes from raw evidence + sealed truth + the external effect ledger.
5. `τ_gt` is oracle-only; no system-under-test principal may read it.
6. `src/sut/` must never import from `src/harness/`. The dependency is one-way.
7. Never `git push --force`; never rewrite remote history.
8. No credentials, tokens, or secrets in the repo or in code. If a push needs auth that is unavailable, STOP and ask the author.

## Layout
`src/sut/` measured system · `src/harness/` instrument · `docs/` design + threat model + frozen parameters · `adr/` one file per decision · `fixtures/pilot` vs `fixtures/confirmatory` strictly disjoint.

`src/sut/oauth_as/` (ADR 0015) is the pinned experiment OAuth 2.1 AS — built at G-4 Phase 2, run out-of-process on loopback, signing key never in an agent process. Two import rules travel with it: no other `src/sut/` module may import it (agents reach it over the wire), and **`src/harness/` may never import it**, notwithstanding the harness's general permission to import `sut` — the oracle and the G-13 verifier reimplement token verification independently (D13/D21). Red line 6 is unchanged.

## Commit convention (Conventional Commits)
`type: summary`, type ∈ {feat, fix, docs, test, build, ci, chore, refactor}. Logically scoped commits (not one giant commit, not one per file). Reference an ADR in the body when a commit encodes a decision. Run `make lint` and `make test` before committing. Push to `origin main` after a coherent unit of work. Never force-push.

## Setup
`make setup` (uv sync) · `make lint` (pre-commit) · `make test` (pytest). Python 3.11+. Determinism: fixed `PYTHONHASHSEED`, single seed source, Ed25519 for signing, RFC 8785 JCS for digests.
