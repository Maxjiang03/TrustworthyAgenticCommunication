"""The latency side — the only sampled quantity, and ADR 0026's decision rule (STEP 9).

§E.5 makes latency *"the **only** quantity with repeated sampling and confidence
intervals (a genuine random quantity)"*, and ADR 0026 fixes what is estimated
and what settles the claim:

* **estimand** — `median(B3) − median(B0)` over the measured segment
  `presentation + boundary_verification`, **warm**;
* **decision rule** — the "lightweight" claim **stands** iff the **upper bound
  of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval** on that difference is **< 20 ms**.
  *A point estimate below the margin with a CI upper bound above it does not
  support the claim*, so this module returns a **verdict and an interval**,
  never a bare number a reader could compare to the margin themselves.

**Three rules are enforced in the code rather than written in a comment,**
because each is a rule about what must NOT be pooled and a comment cannot
refuse:

1. **The chain-tamper exclusion** (ADR 0026, §J.3 item 12). On
   `gt-f1-chain-tamper` the exchange arms perform a **failed AS round trip** and
   receive no token while the capability arms do purely local work. Pooling that
   cell with benign cells would average a network refusal together with local
   cryptography. `benign_series` **raises** on a chain-tamper sample;
   `refusal_series` is where it goes, as its own series.
2. **Cold and warm are separate.** `series` refuses a mixed-phase pool. Cold and
   warm measure different things and §E.5 asks for both, separately.
3. **The decomposition is preserved.** The segment is the **sum of two spans per
   repetition**, paired by `(scenario, batch, repetition)`. A repetition missing
   either span is refused rather than summed from one — a half-measured
   repetition would silently understate the arm that has the other half, and for
   `B3` the missing half would be `presentation`, which is exactly where its
   per-invocation cryptography lives.

**This module never measures anything.** It takes samples as plain numbers from
its caller and has no clock, no timer and no import of the runner. G-3 has not
run and `frozen_parameters` row 9 (the sealed measurement platform) is not
locked, so feeding it a real timing would produce a number ADR 0025 says cannot
count. Its tests use **synthetic** samples whose answer is constructed.

**The RQ4 layer (ADR 0041)** completes what the comment inside
`_segment_values` promises: `setup`, `delegation` and `end_to_end` are
*"reported separately"* — by `span_descriptives`, with the same three refusal
rules re-applied per span. `arm_pair_delta` differences two arms under the
§E.5 bitmask **transcription** below and labels each delta by what that
derivation can actually support, refusing the pairs it is known not to
describe (identical rows — §E.5 carries no bit for the RFC 8693 exchange —
and any pair involving `B1`, whose static shared secret has no bit either,
ADR 0035), and **downgrading to a composite, with the round trip named on
the record**, any single-bit pair that straddles the exchange partition
(`PERFORMS_AS_EXCHANGE` — limit 1's reach, enforced rather than left to the
reader). `llm_turn_fraction` is `frozen_parameters` row 7's secondary
framing. All of it is **descriptives**: the only equivalence decision in this
study remains row 1's, above.
