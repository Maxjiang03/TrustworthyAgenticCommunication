"""The harness runner: correlation, records, and the sealed-truth wall (EXP1 STEP 8).

The instrument side of the golden thread. One `run_scenario` call drives one
scenario under one arm across the whole path -- provision, A2A delegation,
MCP tool call -- and produces the SS F.1 records the oracle will later read:
the sealed `IntendedInvocation`, the `ObservedRequest` assembled from **raw**
evidence, the trusted `MediationEvent`s, and the effect-ledger file. It
adjudicates nothing: no oracle predicate runs here (G-12 territory).

What this module guarantees, each with its own test:

* the **unforgeable 128-bit `correlation_id`** is minted here, per invocation,
  and bound into the sealed intent and every trusted record; the SUT receives
  it (Specialist -> INV `jti` in Phase B) and can never mint one;
* `H(Gamma)` and `H(R)` are verified against `docs/frozen_parameters.md` at
  start-up, **fail closed**, before any scenario runs;
* no SUT-computed verdict and no SUT-computed digest enters any record the
  oracle reads: `raw_arguments` are captured at the mediation boundary (a
  non-bypassable path, gate G-6), digests are recomputed harness-side, and
  `P_hashes` come from the ADR 0003 commitment over the raw presented hops;
* `tau_gt` and every sealed object are reachable only through
  `src/harness/sealed_truth` (red line 5).

The mediation `decide` callable invokes the **arm's** boundary decision and
records the outcome. Part I's "NOT the SUT" is about the **provenance of the
record** -- the trusted mediation layer emits it -- not about who made the
decision: the decision IS the mechanism under measurement. If the arm raises,
the boundary records a denial and the tool does not run (fail closed).

    (SS E.2 Phase 2, the compared quantity), `presentation`,
    `boundary_verification`, and `end_to_end`.

    for the latency to be *decomposed* and redefining an existing span's

        the ADR 0024 task-scoped `AT@aud` and `C_0 = U_task`; `"broad"` gives
        the coarse `Omega` grant the same client also holds, because SS E.4

        make them block it. The arm refuses to provision if the row it declares
        and the row it is handed disagree, so breadth cannot be smuggled in.
        `grant_elements` overrides the element set for a deliberate
        counterfactual; the arm still verifies the token against whatever is
        passed.

        `sut_mode` selects where the SUT runs, and **`"in-process"` is the
        default on purpose**: ten gates were adjudicated in-process, and a
        default flip would silently re-adjudicate all of them (EXP5 STEP 3).
        `"separate"` spawns `src/sut/sut_process` and runs the agents, the arm
        and the arm's decision there, over the pipe.

        **Both modes drive the SAME stack.** The MCP server, the mediation
        boundary, the ingress recorder, the effector and the ledger writer are
        built once, above, and used by both -- a second stack for the separated
        path would let the two modes diverge silently, which would defeat the
        reason for keeping both.

        `fault` is G-12's injection and reaches the SUT only in `"separate"`
        mode, where the child owns its own self-report.

        `artifacts` are the ADR 0030 artifacts the invocation carries —
        `payload_labels`, `declassification`, `approval_artifact`, as
        `label_artifacts.mint_for_scenario` shapes them. They reach the arm
        through the `InvocationContext` **and** the `ObservedRequest`, because
        Part I's `realized_harm_F4`/`_F5` and `reference_allow` read them from
        the observation and an observation that always said `None` would make
        every F4/F5 cell unscorable (EXP6 STEP 6). Empty for an unlabelled
        scenario, which is every F1 scenario — so no existing caller changes.

        `now` lets a **caller that must build something for this cell before
        the cell runs** supply the run's instant, so the cell is judged at the
        instant its material was built at. The one-clock-per-run invariant
        below is unchanged and is the reason this parameter exists: the
        harness mints the ADR 0030 artifacts *before* calling, and without a
        way to hand the same instant down, the artifacts and the run read the
        wall clock separately and the separation grows with the caller's pass.
        It is **not** a frozen `now` from the corpus -- a scenario still
        supplies the validity DURATION and never an instant -- and the only
        caller passes a value it read immediately beforehand. Defaults to
        `None`, which reads the wall clock exactly as before, so no existing
        caller changes.

        `ledger_backed=False` runs the whole thread **without the effect
        ledger**: no `LedgerWriter`, no ingress recorder, and an effector that
        does nothing. It is **not** a POSIX ledger and not a substitute for one
        -- ADR 0014's enforcement is Win32 share-mode locking and has no
        stand-in. It exists so the assertions that do not concern effects (the
        boundary admitted, the tool dispatched and returned, the shape of the
        presented evidence, the sealed-truth relations) have coverage on every
        platform instead of being invisible to CI. Any attempt to read effect
        evidence from such a run **raises** (see `ledger_entries`), so no test
        can mistake the absence of a ledger for the absence of an effect.
