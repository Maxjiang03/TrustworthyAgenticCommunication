"""`Allowed(P_i; Gamma, kappa, Omega)` over the frozen configuration (gate G-2).

This module computes the effective authority set of SS A.0.1

    C_i = Allowed(P_i; Gamma, kappa, Omega)
        = { x in Omega | authorizer(P_i, x; Gamma) = permit
                         and crypto_chain_ok(P_i; kappa) }

by **running the pinned Biscuit authorizer**, exactly as ADR 0016 specifies the
evaluation: one independent authorizer run per candidate `x` in `Omega`, with
`operation(<action>, <resource>)`, `time`, `request_audience` and
`request_task` injected as **authorizer** facts (never token facts), and
membership iff that run selects an `allow` policy. No policy match, or any
failed check, is a **deny** (fail closed).

`Gamma` and `Omega` are read from the frozen artifact through
`frozen_config.load_document()`. Nothing here restates them: the Datalog text
handed to the authorizer is the frozen bytes, and the blocks are rendered from
the frozen templates (`render_block`), so what gate G-2 adjudicates is the
sealed configuration rather than a paraphrase of it.

**Prefix identity is ADR 0003's, not a second notion.** A `Chain` holds one
serialized token per hop; `P_i` is the token at hop `i`, whose blocks are
`<SignedBlock_0, ..., SignedBlock_i>` (SS A.0.1). Block identifiers and prefix
commitments come from `src/harness/oracle/commitment.py` — the same
`BlockID_i` / `commit_prefix` construction G-1 verified — and `Chain` checks
that each hop's identifier list really is a prefix of the next, so the prefix
relation is *verified from signatures*, never assumed from call order.

**Profile enforcement is pre-evaluation** (SS A.6.1 MSc profile MUST): a token
carrying a third-party (external-signature) block, or a non-Ed25519 key, is
refused before any Datalog runs — by `commitment.block_ids_from_raw`, which
this module calls first; and a configuration that permits `trusting`
annotations, trusts more than `kappa`, accepts third-party blocks, or asks for
non-default block scoping is refused before any token is touched.

Scope. This module evaluates authorizer semantics. It is **not** the AS
(gate G-4), implements no arm, no HTC/INV (gate G-11), and no oracle
predicate; the chain builders here mint capability fixtures for gate and
regression use only.
