"""One entry point for the whole matrix — nine arms × every scenario (EXP6 STEP 6–7).

Each gate has its own fixture, which is right for a gate and wrong for a
campaign: a gate isolates one property and builds the smallest world that shows
it, while a campaign must run **every** cell through **one** path so the cells
are comparable. This is that path.

**Its output is EVIDENCE, not verdicts read back.** For every cell it records
the sealed intent, the trusted mediation record, the ledger entries, the
harness's observation, and each Part I quantity **separately** —
`reference_allow`, `observed_forwarded`, `admission_breach`, `realized_harm`,
`false_block`, `log_integrity_failure`. The arm's `reason_code` is recorded
**for diagnosis only**; nothing in the scoring path reads one, and G-12's L2
scan is what makes that structural rather than a promise. The scoring path is
`src/harness/oracle/`, which imports no SUT module and names no verdict field.

**Built OVER the existing stack, never beside it.** `GoldenThreadRunner` builds
the MCP server, the mediation boundary, the ingress recorder and the effector
once; EXP5 established that one stack is what makes the two SUT modes
comparable, and a campaign that assembled its own would be a third.
`the_stack_is_not_duplicated()` asserts that structurally, the way EXP5 STEP 3
asserted it for the modes.

**Preconditions fail closed, with named errors** (STEP 7). A campaign that
silently runs in a wrong configuration produces results nobody can trust, and
the failure would surface as a table rather than as an exception.

**This module runs a campaign; it does not seal one.** `fixtures/confirmatory/`
stays empty, `run_mode` stays `"pilot"`, and nothing here writes to `results/`.
Building the entry point is not running the confirmatory campaign (red lines
1–2).

    **The straddle, fail-closed.** A cell whose artifact was minted at one
    instant and judged at another more than Δ away is not a measurement of the
    mechanism: it measures how long the campaign took to reach that cell. The
    defect this closes was silent in both directions — the arm blocks with its
    own conjunct's reason code, which is what a working mechanism looks like,
    and the oracle was judged at the same stale instant, so `reference_allow`
    agreed and nothing contradicted anything.

    A refused cell is **unscorable**, exactly as an `NA` cell is: not a `B`,
    not a `false_block`, not a result at all.

    **The second check: validity coverage.** Δ is the wrong instrument for a
    credential the harness did not mint at task time. Phase-1 access tokens are
    minted **once, at AS start-up**, live 300 s by a configuration default that
    no frozen row bounds, and are reused by every cell of a pass — so the
    exposure clock starts *earlier than the campaign's own start*. An expired
    one produced two different behaviours and only one of them was visible:
    the capability arms denied through `ConjunctFailed` and were **scored
    `false_block = True` on the benign control**, with `unscorable = 0` and
    `reference_allow` still `True`; the `B2` arms raised `B2ConfigurationError`
    out of `provision` and aborted the pass. One defect, two behaviours, one of
    them silent — and a strong arm that blocks the benign control leaves the F1
    headline with no contrast at all.

    So a cell whose credential does not **cover** the instant it is judged at is
    refused, and one expired token now produces one outcome for every arm.

    **This check must run BEFORE the cell runs**, which is why the caller
    passes the instant it is about to hand the runner rather than reading one
    back off the finished run: the `B2` half raises inside `provision`, so a
    post-run guard would never see it. There is still no second clock — the
    value passed is the same one `run_scenario` is given as `now`, and

    One callable, over `GoldenThreadRunner`. Preconditions are checked **before**
    any arm is provisioned, so a misconfigured campaign costs nothing and
    produces no partial table.

    `monitor_attached` is the run's configuration for the F4/F5 families. It is
    **required** whenever a configuration family is in the scenario set, and
    every such cell is routed through `matrix_grouping.Cell`, which refuses one
    recorded without it — the rule lives there, and this goes through it rather
    than around it (§E.4's `A†` footnote, gate G-15).

    **One clock per cell.** This module used to read `int(time.time())` once for
    the whole pass and mint every scenario's artifacts, build every
    `OracleConfig` and evaluate every credential at it, while `run_scenario`
    read its own `run_epoch` per cell and never received it. The separation grew
    with the pass, and at 61 s — one cell running a minute into a run — twelve
    of eighteen F4/F5 control cells flipped from admitted to blocked, six of
    them scored `false_block`. It could not surface: the oracle was judged at
    the stale instant too, so `reference_allow` agreed with itself.

    So the campaign now **adopts the cell's clock rather than imposing its own**.
    The wall clock is read once per cell, immediately before the run, and handed
    to `run_scenario` as `now`, so the cell is judged at the instant its
    artifacts were built at. Everything computed *after* the run —
    `OracleConfig` and `credential_result` — reads `run.observed.iat`, the
    runner's own epoch, rather than a campaign copy of it: not a convention that
    they agree, but no second value to disagree with. The rejected alternative
    was freezing the cell to a campaign-wide instant, which `run_scenario`'s
    one-clock-per-run invariant forbids for a good reason — the AS mints against
    the real wall clock, and a cell frozen behind it would make a live token
    look unexpired, the same straddle in the plane where F3 lives.

    `artifact_instant` pins the instant the artifacts are minted at while the
    cell still runs on its own clock. **Nothing in production passes it**: it
    reconstructs precisely the defect above, so that `clock_refusal` — the
    fail-closed guard that routes a straddled cell to `unscorable` — has a world
    in which it is watched refusing real cells rather than asserted to work.
