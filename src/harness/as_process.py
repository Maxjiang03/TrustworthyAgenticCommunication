"""Spawn the experiment AS out-of-process and hold its start-up line (ADR 0015/0021).

ADR 0015 rule 1: the AS runs as its own OS process on loopback, started by
the runner via `python -m src.sut.oauth_as <config.json>`, with the sealed
seed in the environment and never on the command line. Rule 4 forbids this
module from IMPORTING the AS package -- spawning a subprocess is not an
import, and the two protocol constants this needs (the module path and the
seed environment variable name) are duplicated here as wire-level facts, the
same way the boundary duplicates token validation rather than importing it.

The start-up JSON line carries the port, the AS public JWK, the TLS
certificate, and (ADR 0021) the Phase-1 base tokens. The pipe is held HERE,
by the runner; the tokens are runtime-only and MUST never be written to
disk, committed, or echoed into `results/` (ADR 0021 rule 2) -- this class
keeps them in memory and exposes them to the composition root only.

    Phase-1 provisioning note (ADR 0021 / SS E.2): the base token expresses NO
    delegation authority -- it establishes MCP resource authorization and the
    OAuth actor identity only. The pilot therefore provisions the COARSE
    RS-level grant (the whole frozen Omega at this one resource server, scope
    `mcp.invoke`); in B3 the capability is the narrowing plane and effective
    authority is the SS A.4 intersection, which the coarse base grant leaves
    to the capability.

    **`task_grant`, and why the coarse default cannot serve every arm.** In
    `B2-exchange-task` there is no capability plane: the TOKEN is the authority
    plane, and the AS enforces `C_i subset-of C_{i-1}` against the subject
    token's own `authorization_details`. Left coarse, the delegating party's
    base token would carry the whole of `Omega`, so the AS would enforce only
    `C_1 subset-of Omega` -- and an `F1-chain-tamper` hop widening to
    `(mail.send, mail/outbox)`, an element that IS in `Omega`, would be
    **issued** rather than refused (SS E.3 expects a block, and forbidden
    action 3 forbids weakening `B2`). `task_grant` therefore provisions the
    delegating client's base `AT@aud` with authority exactly `C_0 = U_task`,
    which is the OAuth analogue of SS A.3's "the AS mints `U_task` as `P_0`;
    the Supervisor only narrows". The path, the shape and the minting call are
    ADR 0021's, unchanged and identical to `B3`'s; only this one client's
    granted set differs, and every other client -- including the specialist,
    whose base token is the one `B3` presents -- keeps the coarse grant.

    **This parameter is opt-in and its default is the dangerous value**, so it
    is deliberately not the only thing standing between the study and a
    silently misprovisioned arm: `B2ExchangeTaskArm.provision` reads the
    authority of the token it actually holds and REFUSES unless it equals the
    run's `U_task`. Forgetting `task_grant` here therefore fails loudly at
    provisioning rather than quietly costing `B2` a block.
