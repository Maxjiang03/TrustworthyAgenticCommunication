"""The sealed measurement platform, **read from the machine** (`frozen_parameters` row 9).

Row 9 is the last open frozen row and it is the only one that is **read rather
than chosen**: ADR 0014 binds the campaign to Windows, and ADR 0025 requires the
G-3 adjudication to happen on a platform identified exactly, because *"any
change to row 9 invalidates a G-3 adjudication on the previous platform."*

**Every value here comes from the machine.** A transcription is a cross-check,
never the source: a mismatch between what the machine says and what a human
wrote down is **reported, not reconciled**, and the machine-read value is what
gets sealed.

**Why this module exists at all rather than a shell one-liner.** The measurement
this platform carries is taken on a **hybrid-architecture laptop**, and two of
its properties would *bias* a timing result rather than merely add noise:

1. **P-core / E-core scheduling.** The i7-12700H has performance and efficiency
   cores and Windows Thread Director moves threads between them. Repetitions
   landing on an E-core are substantially slower, so the distribution goes
   **bimodal and its spread is the scheduler's, not the mechanism's** — which
   §E.5's p95 and IQR would then report as the mechanism's. `performance_cpus()`
   detects the efficiency class through `GetSystemCpuSetInformation` and **fails
   closed** if it cannot: a guessed mask would silently reintroduce exactly the
   bias it exists to remove.
2. **AC versus battery.** A laptop on battery throttles whatever the power plan
   says. `require_ac_power()` refuses rather than measuring.

Nothing here times anything. It identifies and constrains the machine; the
measurement is `smoke/g3/`'s.

    **This is the second instance of a defect class this repository has already
    paid for once** (DEVIATIONS D-007; the first was `smoke/g10/spike.py`, fixed
    a seal earlier at v0.7, where `subprocess(text=True)` with no `encoding=`
    threw on cp936 and discarded fourteen subgates' evidence).

    Why a fixed encoding is not the fix here. `powercfg` writes the localised
    power-scheme name in the OEM codepage, and **what reaches this process
    depends on the PARENT**: under a `bash`/`cmd` parent the nested PowerShell
    emits **GBK**, under a **PowerShell** parent it emits **UTF-8**. Both were
    measured. So:

    - `text=True` with no `encoding=` (what this did) decodes with the locale
      codepage: correct under `bash`, and a hard `UnicodeDecodeError` under
      PowerShell, which made row 9 unreadable and G-3 unadjudicable there;
    - `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` fixes the PowerShell parent and
      **silently turns the correct name into U+FFFD under `bash`** — the shell
      every G-3 run and every row 9 read has actually used. That trades a loud
      failure for a quiet wrong answer **in the code that reads the sealed
      measurement platform**, which is the wrong direction.

    So each candidate encoding is tried **strictly**, in order, and the first
    that decodes cleanly wins — GBK bytes are rejected by UTF-8 on their first
    lead byte, and UTF-8 bytes are accepted before the locale codepage is
    reached. If none decodes, this **raises** rather than returning replacement
    characters: `errors="replace"` would put mojibake into a sealed platform
    fact, and this module's rule is that a value it cannot read is *reported,
