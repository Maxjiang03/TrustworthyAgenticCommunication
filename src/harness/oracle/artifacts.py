"""Oracle-side artifact validation — Part I's `valid_*` helpers (EXP6 STEP 3).

Part I names four helpers and defines none of them:

    is_sensitive(lbl)                       valid_declassification(obs, lbl, e)
    is_high_risk(action)                    valid_approval_binds(approval, e)

The first two are **row 10** of the frozen label/approval policy (ADR 0022) and
already exist harness-side in `src/harness/policy/frozen_policy.py`; they are
re-exported here so the oracle reaches one implementation. The other two are
built here.

**Why not reuse the SUT's monitor.** `src/sut/authz/reference_monitor.py`
verifies the same artifacts, and importing it would be a red line 4 violation
in substance even though the values are not "verdicts": the oracle would be
accepting the measured system's arithmetic about whether the measured system's
own input was valid. D21's rule is an independent implementation, which is what
this is — the same rule that made `matched_authority.py` reimplement token
verification rather than share the boundary's.

**Trust anchors are a REQUIRED argument, never a default.** `OracleConfig` has
no default trusted-key set and no default policy. An artifact validates only
against keys the caller names, because a defaulted trusted set would let an
artifact signed by any key in the process validate — and the F4/F5 controls
would then pass for the wrong reason. Fail closed is the whole discipline here:
every helper below returns `False` on anything it cannot positively verify.

**What each reads.** Only raw evidence (the presented artifact bytes, which the
harness observed at the boundary), the trusted ledger (`EffectEvent` fields),
sealed truth (`intent`), and sealed configuration (`OracleConfig`). No SUT
verdict, no SUT digest, no reason code, no audit record.
