"""The attacker between the arm and the resource server (EXP7 STEP 3).

Five §E.4 subcases are **credential attacks, not authority-scope attacks**. Every
scenario the corpus carried before them was expressible as **data** — tool,
arguments, `R`, chain — and none of these five is: each needs a specific
**corruption of the runtime credential**, which the generator has no vocabulary
for. The fault is declared in the **sealed** document and realized here, per
mechanism — the *intent realized per mechanism* pattern `widening_elements`
already uses for chain-tamper. Sealed, **never SUT-visible**: a visible fault
would let an arm branch on *"I am under attack."*

**Every fault is presentation-level. There is no provisioning level.** The first
design proposed one and building it disproved it: `B2ExchangeTaskArm.provision`
calls `verify_access_token` on the injected subject token and raises
`B2ConfigurationError` — a check that exists on purpose, so `B2` cannot be
misprovisioned — so a provisioning-level corruption tests the arm's
**configuration** and raises **before the boundary is reached**. No
`MediationEvent`, nothing for the oracle, while §E.4's rows are about what the
**boundary** does. §D.2 said so all along: every one of its four adversaries
**holds a captured credential and presents it**, or sits between proof signing
and the TLS client. None tampers with what the arm was legitimately provisioned
with.

**It re-signs and re-stages; it never weakens.** No arm is modified, no conjunct
disabled, nothing made easier to pass. What the boundary receives is a
well-formed artifact presented by the wrong party or bound to the wrong token —
which is the attack.

**`B1` has its own limb, and its absence was a real defect.** `B1`'s credential
is a **static API key** (`api_key_secret`); it carries no `access_token` at all.
A token fault therefore left it untouched and it **admitted**, while §E.4
predicts **B**. That is the **second** place `B1`'s secret plane went missing
from an abstraction — the first is §E.5's bitmask, which has no column for it
(ADR 0035). Any future mechanism enumerating credentials must ask what `B1`
carries rather than enumerating the two mechanisms that happen to be interesting.
