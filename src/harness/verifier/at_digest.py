"""`INV.access_token_hash` -- the frozen digest binding the presented OAuth token.

ADR 0018, adjudicating `smoke/g4/DESIGN.md` SS 9 C2 and closing ADR 0009's
category (c) for this field. SS F.2 gives the field as `H(AT@aud)` and fixes no
construction; this is that construction.

    t                  = the access token exactly as presented at the boundary,
                         its compact serialization, ASCII bytes
    access_token_hash  = lowercase_hex( SHA-256( TAG || 0x01 || u32be(len(t)) || t ) )

Same tagged, versioned, length-delimited family as ADR 0003 `commitment.py`,
ADR 0009 `jcs_digest.py` and ADR 0016 `frozen_config.py`, with its **own** domain
tag and no algorithm byte (a hash change is a new VERSION, not a parameter), and
fail-closed on an unsupported version.

**Three digests over the same token, deliberately mutually distinct.** SS 9 C2
named this trap and it is real:

| Digest | Over | Rendering |
|---|---|---|
| `ath` (RFC 9449 SS 4.2) | ASCII **token string** | base64url, unpadded |
| `H_JCS` (ADR 0009) | canonical bytes of a **JSON object** | lowercase hex |
| `access_token_hash` (here) | ASCII **token string** | lowercase hex |

`ath` and this construction take the same input bytes, so **only the domain tag
and the output encoding keep them apart** -- which is exactly why the tag is
load-bearing rather than decorative, and why a test asserts all three differ.

**Non-ASCII input fails closed.** A JWS compact serialization is base64url
characters and dots by construction, so any byte outside ASCII means the input is
not a well-formed presented token. It is refused rather than encoded as UTF-8,
which would silently admit two different byte strings to one digest.

Trust rule (D21): this module is instrument-side. The B3 arm's INV signer must
compute the same value with an **independent** implementation, and the verifier
never consumes a SUT-computed digest -- it recomputes from the presented token.
