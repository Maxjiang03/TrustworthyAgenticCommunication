"""The B3 boundary decision path: every SS A.5 conjunct a named function (EXP1 STEP 12).

Ten conjuncts, evaluated in the specification's order, each carrying its own
reason code so a block is attributable to exactly one condition -- the shape
gate G-11 established harness-side, now built SUT-side and independently:

    crypto_chain_ok                  b3_crypto_chain
    authorizer_policy_ok             b3_authorizer_policy
    htc_chain_ok                     b3_htc_chain
    holder_proof_ok                  b3_holder_proof
    invocation_binding_ok            b3_invocation_binding
    R subset-of C_n                  b3_containment
    context_policy_ok                b3_context_policy
    approval_artifact_ok             b3_approval_artifact
    oauth_resource_authorization_ok  b3_oauth_resource_authorization
    identity_plane_consistency_ok    b3_identity_plane_consistency

`C_n = Allowed(P_n; Gamma, kappa, Omega)` is computed HERE, SUT-side, by
`src/sut/capability/authority.py` -- one authorizer run per candidate, as
G-2 did, never asserted and never imported from the harness (red line 6).

**The authorizer-policy / containment split, so authority blocks are never
masked.** SS A.5 lists `authorizer_policy_ok(P_n; Gamma)` and `R subset-of
C_n` as separate conjuncts, and they overlap by construction -- `C_n` is
itself computed by running the authorizer, so an out-of-authority element
"fails the authorizer" too. G-11's masking lesson decides the split: an
F1 amplification MUST be attributable to containment, which is also what
Part I's `reference_allow` (`R subset-of C_sets[-1]`) scores. So
`authorizer_policy_ok` owns the **check plane** -- `Gamma`'s own checks
(expiry, audience, task) plus the SS A.6.1 out-of-profile structural
rejection -- and the **authority** question falls through to containment.

Discriminating the two needs care, and the first attempt was wrong: the
pinned library's denial message lists **every** failed check, including the
attenuation block's own `check if operation(...), scope(...)`, which is the
narrowing -- i.e. the authority plane. Matching "checks failed" alone
therefore attributed every F1 block to `authorizer_policy_ok` and **masked
containment**; the counterfactual suite caught it.

**The discriminator is now STRUCTURAL, not textual** (EXP2 STEP 7). The check
plane is evaluated against **`P_0`**, the authority prefix, which carries no
attenuation block -- so nothing there can fail for a narrowing reason, and
`Allowed(P_0; Gamma, kappa, Omega)` is empty **iff** one of `Gamma`'s own
checks refused.

**Sound by CONSTRUCTION, not merely by probe.** Read off the frozen templates
(ADR 0016), and each clause is asserted by test:

1. the **authority block template carries no `check` at all** -- it is four
   facts (`right/2`, `token_audience/1`, `token_task/1`, `expiry/1`);
2. the **only token-carried check** is the attenuation template's, and it
   consumes `scope/2`, a predicate that appears in **neither** block 0 nor
   `Gamma`;
3. `Gamma`'s three checks consume `expiry/1`, `token_audience/1`,
   `token_task/1` (block-0 facts) plus injected facts, and **none mentions
   `operation/2`** -- so they are candidate-independent and either all pass or
   some fail regardless of which element is probed.

`P_0` contains only block 0, so by (1) the only checks that can run against it
are `Gamma`'s, and by (3) their verdict does not depend on the candidate.
`Allowed(P_0)` is therefore empty exactly when a `Gamma` check refused (or the
authority block grants nothing in `Omega` -- the residual below).

**The dependency this creates, stated because it is easy to lose:** any
`Gamma` amendment re-triggers gate **G-2** *and* this soundness argument. A
future `Gamma` whose check consumed `scope/2`, or an authority block template
that gained a check, or a `Gamma` check that mentioned `operation/2`, would
each break a clause above -- so the structural test is part of what an
amendment must re-establish, not merely the gate.

Four probes established the behaviour on `biscuit-python==0.4.0` before it was
adopted, and the regression suite pins all four:

| probe | outcome against `P_0` |
|---|---|
| inside `C_0`, failing `Gamma` check | `Allowed(P_0)` **empty** -> the check plane |
| inside `C_0`, narrowed away at hop 1 | **permitted** -> falls through to containment |
| outside `C_0` entirely | denied, but no check failed; `Allowed(P_0)` non-empty -> falls through |
| outside `C_0` **and** a failing `Gamma` check | `Allowed(P_0)` **empty** -> the check plane |

No denial message is parsed on the decision path any more. `gamma_checks_in`
below is retained **only** as an independent second witness for the
regression suite -- a canary that fires if a library bump changes the message
shapes the earlier reading depended on.

**Residual, stated rather than hidden:** a capability whose authority block
grants nothing inside `Omega` yields an empty `Allowed(P_0)` for that reason
alone, and is attributed to `authorizer_policy_ok` rather than to
containment. `C_0 = U_task` is non-empty in every scenario the design defines,
so this is degenerate here; it is recorded because the attribution, not the
outcome, is what would differ.

**Orthogonality for the SS E.6 ablations.** `invocation_binding_ok` checks
the INV's *bindings* and window but never re-verifies its signature -- who
signed is `holder_proof_ok`'s question (with `htc_chain_ok`, the -holder
pair). That separation is what makes each ablation a matched leave-one-out.
The `disabled` set is that seam: a disabled conjunct is skipped and recorded,
never silently absent. This pass uses it only for the STEP 13
would-have-failed counterfactuals; no ablation arm is built (forbidden 11).

**The two policy conjuncts are load-bearing in BOTH halves** (rows 4/6/10 frozen
by ADR 0022, composition amended by ADR 0023, constructions fixed by ADR 0030).
The policy object is injected configuration and construction fails without one;
both planes evaluate the same frozen bytes and neither imports the other's
evaluation. The acceptance half is delegated to the **boundary-owned reference
monitor** (`src/sut/authz/reference_monitor.py`), which is handed in as
configuration: with no monitor attached both conjuncts refuse everything
presented, exactly as before. Acceptance is earned by VERIFICATION -- a
signature under a trusted issuer, the artifact's own window, its binding to
THIS request's `authz_context_hash`, and its single-use rule -- never by the
removal of a refusal.
*(Update notes, each true when written: (1) "Two conjuncts cannot honestly be
frozen yet (rows 4/6/10 UNSET)", superseded by ADR 0022/0023; (2) "load-bearing
in their REFUSAL half only ... F4/F5 stay unscored until then", superseded by
ADR 0030 on 2026-08-01.)*

`audit = 1` for B3: the structured JSONL decision log is emitted OFF the
decision path -- a sink failure can cost log completeness, never a
prevention outcome (SS E.5).
