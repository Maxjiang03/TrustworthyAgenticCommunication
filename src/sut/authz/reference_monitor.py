"""The boundary-owned context/approval reference monitor (ADR 0030, gate G-15).

SS F.2 makes `authz_context_hash` **mechanism-neutral** for exactly one reason:
so that **one** monitor can serve every arm. This is that monitor. It takes the
frozen policy (rows 4/6/10, ADR 0022/0023), the trusted issuer sets, and the
artifacts a request presents -- and it takes **nothing** that only a capability
arm could supply. An OAuth arm holding no capability token attaches the same
class over the same policy without modification, which is what makes the
comparison gate **G-15** governs possible at all. If it could only be attached
to `B3`, that comparison would be impossible and every F4/F5 number would be a
statement about which arm happened to have a monitor.

**Attachment is CONFIGURATION, not an arm property.** An arm runs with
`monitor_attached ∈ {true, false}` and its trace records which. That is what
makes SS E.4's `A†` -- *admitted **absent** the shared monitor* -- expressible
rather than flattened into a plain `A`.

**The acceptance half is VERIFICATION, not the removal of a refusal.** Block 2
found `_context_policy_ok` reading `entry.get("label")` off an unverified
mapping, and the fix was to refuse everything. This monitor does not undo that
refusal: it *earns* an acceptance by checking a signature under a trusted issuer,
the artifact's own window, its binding to **this** request's
`authz_context_hash`, the frozen policy version it was issued under, and its
single-use rule. Anything that fails any of those is refused exactly as before,
with the condition named.

**Two windows, and no third.** ADR 0027's `Delta` governs the two artifacts that
authorize *this* invocation -- a `DeclassificationArtifact` and an
`ApprovalArtifact` are per-request objects, so `|now - iat| <= Delta` applies.
A `LabelAssertion` is **not** per-request: SS A.6 states that labels *"are
asserted at ingestion by a trusted source (they exist before task-time capability
issuance)"*, so applying `Delta` to one would refuse every genuinely pre-labelled
payload and make the MSc model unimplementable. Its bound is its own issuer-set
`iat`/`exp`, which is the artifact's own validity rather than a fourth window
constant. ADR 0030 records that asymmetry as a decision rather than leaving it
to be inferred.

**Two trusted sets, deliberately disjoint.** A **label issuer** asserts what data
*is*; an **approver** authorizes an *action*. Conflating them would let whoever
labels a payload also approve a high-risk action on it, so the sets are separate
by kid and by derivation label, and a signature from one set is refused in the
other's domain.
