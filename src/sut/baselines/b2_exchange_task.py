"""`B2-exchange-task`: the fair strong OAuth arm (SS E.1, SS E.5 bits
`1 0 0 0 0 (scope in token) 0 0 0 1`).

OAuth 2.1 with an online RFC 8693 token exchange at **every** delegation hop,
narrowed to `C_i` and carried as RFC 9396 `authorization_details` under the
ADR 0017 project RAR type. It gets **no** capability-layer conjunct and must
not be given one: no crypto chain, no HTC, no INV, no policy plane.
Containment is enforced **by the AS-issued token's own scope**, which is what
the SS E.5 parenthetical marks -- not by a boundary module.

**Built to win on its own terms** (EXP2 forbidden action 3 -- never weaken a
baseline to manufacture an advantage). SS E.4's prediction, and SS E.1's
paste-ready headline, are that a well-configured token-exchange deployment
prevents scope amplification, because it enforces the same narrowed `C_n`. If
this arm did not block `F1-root` and `F1-terminal` that would be a defect in
its provisioning, not a finding about OAuth. And `B3` blocking where this arm
also blocks is **not** evidence of an advantage for `B3`: the arms differ on
invocation binding, holder binding, and online-versus-offline narrowing, which
are other families and another axis.

**Two phases (SS E.2).**

* *Phase 1* is the ADR 0021 base `AT@aud` from the AS start-up line -- the
  same pre-issued path, the same `issue_initial` call and the same shape as
  `B3`'s. The delegating client's base token carries authority exactly
  `C_0 = U_task`, because here the token IS the authority plane and the AS
  enforces `C_i subset-of C_{i-1}` against the subject token's own grant.
  **The arm checks this itself and refuses otherwise** -- see
  `_check_subject_token_is_the_task_grant`, which exists because a coarse base
  token would silently make `F1-chain-tamper` issuable and would cost this arm
  a block it should win.
* *Phase 2* is, at each hop, a real **online** round trip to the running AS.
  That round trip **is** the measured difference from the capability arms and
  is never shortcut: no cached token, no offline mint, no local narrowing.

**Anti-bias, and it is the dangerous direction.** Gratuitous AS cost inflates
`B2` **toward `B3`** -- toward this project's own hypothesis. G-4 found a real
0.7 s-per-hop `::1` fallback by measurement rather than by reading
(`smoke/g4/DESIGN.md` SS 8.2). Four things are therefore fixed here, each
asserted **structurally** by a test and **never** by timing (EXP2 forbidden
actions 4 and 5 -- nothing in this pass measures a duration):

1. the client dials the literal loopback address `127.0.0.1`, never the name
   `localhost`, whose resolution tries `::1` first on a dual-stack host;
2. one TLS context and one keep-alive HTTP/1.1 connection are built at
   provisioning time and reused across every hop;
3. no key is parsed on the request path -- the actor-assertion signing key and
   the boundary's AS public key are parsed once, at provisioning;
4. no disk I/O on the request path -- the TLS trust anchor arrives as PEM
   **text** in the injected configuration (`cadata=`), never as a file.

**Isolation.** This module imports nothing from `src/sut/oauth_as/` (ADR 0015
rule 3): it reaches the AS over the wire, and the three RFC 8693 URNs it needs
are duplicated here as wire-level protocol facts, the way the boundary
duplicates token validation rather than importing it. Its client secret and
its actor-assertion key arrive as injected start-up configuration, derived
harness-side by `src/harness/key_material` from the sealed seed; neither
touches disk (PROJECT_RULES.md red line 8).

At the boundary the arm presents `AT_n` as a bearer token and the decision is
`src/sut/authz/boundary.py` **unchanged** -- `verify_access_token`,
`allowed_authority` via `admits`.

        **This arm can otherwise be misprovisioned silently, and it fails
        TOWARD the hypothesis.** The AS enforces `C_i subset-of C_{i-1}`
        against the subject token's OWN `authorization_details`, so a base
        token left at the pilot's coarse `Omega` grant means the AS enforces
        only `C_1 subset-of Omega`. `F1-chain-tamper` widens to
        `(mail.send, mail/outbox)`, an element that IS in `Omega`, so the AS
        would **issue** the widened `AT_1`, this arm would lose SS E.3's
        predicted block for a provisioning reason, and `B3` would appear to
        win a comparison it did not win. Forbidden action 3 forbids weakening
        `B2` in any respect; being provisioned so its own containment check is
        toothless is exactly that.

        ADR 0024 put the fix in the AS document, which left the guarantee with
        the CALLER -- and `task_grant` is opt-in with the dangerous value as
        its default. The guarantee lives here instead: the arm reads the
        authority of the token it actually holds, out of that token's own
        claims, and refuses to provision unless it equals the `U_task` it was
        given for the run. Being correctly provisioned today is not the same
        property as being impossible to misprovision.

        The equality is `==`, not `subset-of`: a subject token carrying LESS
        than its row's grant would make the arm unable to pass on what the row
        specifies and would show up as a spurious block, which is the opposite
        bias and equally unacceptable.

        **ADR 0029 generalises the check without weakening it.** `U_task` is
        the STRONG rows' grant; the BROAD rows' is the coarse `Omega`, because
        SS E.4 predicts they ADMIT `F1-root` and `(mail.send, mail/outbox)`
        lies outside `U_task` -- on a task-scoped token a broad arm would
        block it, contradicting SS E.4 and destroying the arm whose whole job
        is to isolate the exchange round trip FROM narrowing. Which grant
        applies is read from `type(self).ladder_grant`, checked above, so the
