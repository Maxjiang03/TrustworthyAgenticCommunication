"""`B1`: a static API key (SS E.5 bits `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1`).

SS E.1's appendix arm, and its `Isolates` column is the whole point: **a static
secret adds nothing**. `B1` sits between `B0` (no delegation protection at all)
and the OAuth arms, and exists to show that adding *authentication* without
adding *authorization* moves no F1 outcome.

A shared secret is presented at the boundary and checked for equality. It
expresses **no authority**, **no audience binding** and **no scope**, and this
module is written so that is honestly true rather than merely intended: `decide`
takes `tool` and `arguments` and **reads neither** -- there is no code path by
which the invocation could influence the verdict, exactly as `B0`'s constant
return makes `B0` incapable of deciding anything. An arm that quietly consulted
the request would stop being the control the ladder needs.

**Expected, per SS E.4, and the admissions are the measurement.** `B1` **admits**
`F1-root` and `F1-terminal` -- a valid key authenticates a caller who is then
free to exceed the task grant -- and **blocks** `F2 invalid_credential` and
`F2 unauthenticated_caller`. `F1-chain-tamper` is **NA**: `B1` has no per-hop
authority chain to tamper with (SS E.3), and that NA is recorded as **data the
matrix fixture reads** from the sealed record, exactly as `B0`'s is, never as a
skipped cell.

**The key is `(key_id, secret)`, and only the id reaches any record.** SS F.1's
`ApiKeyEvidence` carries `raw_key_ref`, a *reference* -- so the id travels into
the observed evidence and the secret never does. The secret itself is injected
as start-up configuration, derived harness-side from the sealed seed, and
touches no disk (PROJECT_RULES.md red line 8). A wrong secret under a valid id is
still distinguishable in the record, which a bare "which key was used" label
would not be.

`audit = 1`, like every arm above `B0`: the structured decision log is emitted
OFF the decision path, into the same bounded in-memory buffer ADR 0026
requires, so a sink failure costs log completeness and never a prevention
outcome (SS E.5).
